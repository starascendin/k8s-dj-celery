Apple''s LLM, BritGPT, Ernie and AlexaTM)', '8 years of cost reduction in 5 weeks: how Stanford''s Alpaca model changes everything, including the economics of OpenAI and GPT 4. The breakthrough, using self-instruct, has big implications for Apple''s secret large language model, Baidu''s ErnieBot, Amazon''s attempts and even governmental efforts, like the newly announced BritGPT.

I will go through how Stanford put the model together, why it costs so little, and demonstrate in action versus Chatgpt and GPT 4. And what are the implications of short-circuiting human annotation like this? With analysis of a tweet by Eliezer Yudkowsky, I delve into the workings of the model and the questions it rises.

In this video, Charlie Munger brings us back to his early days in Omaha amidst the Great Depression. He tells stories about his grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles and how they cope. He speaks of the values passed on to him from his elders and that one is no poorer by holding on to high standards. He also shares about Warren Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, and their trials, tribulations, and successes. There are very few people who can give us a first-hand account of the Great Depression and Charlie Munger is one of them.
 
Charles Thomas Munger is a wise, perspicacious American billionaire investor, businessman, and lawyer who gets to the core of complex matters in seconds. He cuts to the chase, and often which his unique sense of humor. He is the Vice-Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and business partner of Warren Buffett. Their friendship is legendary and worthy of emulation.

I believe this is one of the easiest side hustles you could do this year. From getting the ideas, leveraging AI (ChatGPT and MidJoureny) I cover everything from start to finish. One of the shops I talk about in this video is making over $25,000 a month in passive income PROFIT from selling this kind of art. Thanks for watching!

LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build scalable AI/LLM apps. Supabase is an open source Postgres database that can store embeddings using a pg vector extension.

We''ll discuss the process of extracting relevant data from website links,  "embedding" the vectors using Openai''s embedding function, storing the embeddings in Supabase, and querying(asking a question) to ''chat'' with your website data.

Whether you run or work for a business (or personal brand), you know how important it is to connect with your audiences/customers in a timely manner as soon as they interact with your brand/website (otherwise they will bounce).   

Chatbots give your brand/website a fighting chance of connecting with your ideal audience by creating a personalized, interactive, and immediate response to their questions. 24/7 whether you''re there or not.

directions (77s)-feelings of guilt lust or fear were (80s)-often stronger than reasoning (84s)-Freud said that the mind is divided into (87s)-three parts (88s)-the ego the conscious rational self the

(140s)-more control over the ID and more (143s)-independence from the superego (149s)-the older metaphors about controlling (152s)-animals work beautifully (154s)-throughout recorded history people have (156s)-lived with and tried to control animals (159s)-and these animals made their way into (162s)-ancient metaphors (164s)-Buddha for example compared the mind to (167s)-a wild elephant

control even as a (185s)-wild elephant is controlled by the (187s)-trainer (191s)-Plato used a similar metaphor in which (194s)-the self or soul is a chariot and the (199s)-calm rational part of the Mind holds the (201s)-Reigns (202s)-Plato''s charioteer had to control two (206s)-horses (207s)-the horse that is on the right or nobler (210s)-side is upright in frame and well (213s)-jointed with a

together to do a job but who (440s)-often find themselves working at Cross (442s)-purposes (446s)-human rationality depends critically on (449s)-sophisticated emotionality (452s)-it is only because our emotional brains (455s)-work so well that our reasoning can work (458s)-at all (464s)-reason and emotion must both work (468s)-together to create intelligent Behavior (481s)-the moment one stops trying to suppress (484s)-a thought the thought comes flooding in (487s)-and becomes even harder to banish when (490s)-controlled processing tries to influence (493s)-thought (494s)-don''t think about a white bear (496s)-it sets up an explicit goal and whenever (501s)-one pursues a goal a part of the Mind (503s)-automatically monitors progress so that (506s)-it can order Corrections or know when (509s)-success has been achieved when that goal (511s)-is an action in the world such as (514s)-arriving at the airport on time this (517s)-feedback system works well (519s)-but when the goal is mental it backfires (523s)-automatic processes continually check (527s)-am I not thinking about a white bear (529s)-as the act of monitoring for the absence (532s)-of the thought introduces the thought (534s)-the person must try even harder to (537s)-divert Consciousness automatic and (540s)-controlled processes end up working at (542s)-Cross purposes firing each other up to (545s)-ever greater exertions (547s)-but because controlled processes Tire (550s)-quickly eventually the inexhaustible (553s)-automatic processes run unopposed (555s)-Conjuring up herds of white Bears thus (559s)-the attempt to remove an unpleasant (562s)-thought can guarantee it a place on your (565s)-frequent playlist of mental ruminations (569s)-we sometimes fall into the view that we (572s)-are fighting with our unconscious our ID (575s)-our animal self (578s)-but really we are the whole thing we are (582s)-the writer and we are the elephant both (585s)-have their strengths and special skills (591s)-Marcus Aurelius wrote (594s)-the whole universe is change and life (597s)-itself is but what you deem it (600s)-Buddha taught (603s)-what we are today comes from our (605s)-thoughts of yesterday and our present (608s)-thoughts build our life of tomorrow (611s)-our life is the creation of our mind (620s)-events in the world affect us only (623s)-through our interpretations of them so (626s)-if we can control our interpretations we (629s)-can control our world (631s)-there is no reality only perception (635s)-the art of pop psychology is to develop (638s)-a method Beyond lecturing and hectoring (641s)-that guides people to that realization (646s)-self-help books and seminars sometimes (648s)-seem to consist of little more than (650s)-lecturing and hectoring people until (652s)-they understand this idea and its (655s)-implications for their lives (658s)-to take something philosophically means (662s)-to accept a great Misfortune without (664s)-weeping or even suffering (666s)-we use this term in part because of the (669s)-calmness self-control and courage that (672s)-three ancient philosophers Socrates (675s)-Seneca and boethius showed while they (679s)-awaited their executions (685s)-but in the consolation of philosophy (688s)-which boethius wrote while in prison (691s)-he confessed that at first he was (693s)-anything but philosophical (697s)-he wept and wrote poems about weeping he (702s)-cursed Injustice and old age and the (706s)-goddess of Fortune who had blessed him (708s)-and then abandoned him (713s)-then one night while boethius is (716s)-wallowing in his wretchedness The (719s)-Majestic Apparition of Lady philosophy (722s)-visits him and proceeds to chide him for (725s)-his unphilosophical behavior (731s)-lady philosophy then Guides boethius (733s)-Through reinterpretations that (736s)-foreshadow modern cognitive therapy (742s)-Begins by by asking boethius to think (744s)-about his relationship with the goddess (747s)-of Fortune (749s)-philosophy reminds boethius that fortune (753s)-is fickle coming and going as she (755s)-pleases (756s)-boethius took Fortune as his mistress (759s)-fully aware of her ways and she stayed (763s)-with him for a long time (766s)-what right has he now to demand that she (769s)-be chained to his side (771s)-lady philosophy presents fortunes (774s)-defense (782s)-the heavens are permitted to Grant (784s)-bright days then blot them out with Dark (788s)-Knights (790s)-the Year may decorate the face of the (792s)-Earth with flowers and fruits then make (795s)-it Barren again

American citizens moving forward (31s)-for decades Mexico is our number one (33s)-trading partner and it is also the (36s)-vector by which we absorb cocaine into (38s)-this country so we have set up a (40s)-situation where all of our interests (42s)-Allied and are being dealt with in a (44s)-very very bad manner not just by this (46s)-Administration but by the previous one (48s)-and the one before that and the one (49s)-before that and the one before that this (51s)-is not a new problem (53s)-okay so economics of drugs it''s (56s)-obviously about the cocaine I mean it''s (59s)-like you can put a half a million (60s)-dollars of product in your backpack of (61s)-course it''s about the cocaine and (63s)-because it has a very high value to cost (65s)-it is very easy to smuggle uh and so it (69s)-doesn''t really matter if you have a wall (70s)-uh because somebody with a backpack will (72s)-just hop it and make you know make (74s)-themselves very very wealthy very very (75s)-quickly but once you get cocaine you (78s)-then are left for the big Fistful of (79s)-cash and you can''t exactly put it in the (81s)-Local Credit Union so what happens is (84s)-the cartels try to get into businesses (86s)-where there''s a fair amount of cash that (88s)-flows through them so agricultural (90s)-harvesting or processing are relatively (94s)-popular as are things like real estate (98s)-and rental properties they''re big fans (100s)-of bars uh what they do is they try to (103s)-get a facility that has a lot of cash (104s)-flow through and then they just feed (106s)-some of their drug profits through it (108s)-and report it as income and that it can (110s)-get laundered and into the financial (112s)-system at Large and in Mexico Indy in (115s)-the United States this has brought them (117s)-into things like avocado and line (119s)-production this has brought them into (121s)-tourism uh this has brought them into (123s)-real estate rentals uh up to and (126s)-including just like you know residential (128s)-real estate multi-family housing (130s)-uh the more you do this in a community (132s)-the more you start distorting the Local (136s)-Economic environment and that means you (138s)-have to put another layer into it and (139s)-you have to get into the political Elite (141s)-and that means going into universities (143s)-uh going into institutions going to the (145s)-local government and buying them off so (147s)-that the tax man doesn''t look too close (149s)-at the books and this is how you kind of (152s)-hollow out systems from the inside and (154s)-this is one of the things that Sinaloa (156s)-under El Chapo started to do in places (158s)-like rural Texas because it allowed him (161s)-to get a foothold north of the Border (163s)-South of the Border there is not a a (166s)-city in which this has not happened to (169s)-some degree but it''s really really (170s)-popular in agricultural regions and (173s)-places where tourism is really strong (175s)-like in the Yucatan Peninsula or in Cabo (178s)-now once a cartel reaches a certain (180s)-point they have enough resources they (182s)-can reach up and down the supply chain (184s)-if you go north into the United States (187s)-you go on and you start interfacing with (189s)-the drug infrastructure for distribution (191s)-and that takes you head to head with a (192s)-lot of the gangs that you either (193s)-co-upped or kill if you go the other (195s)-direction you go up into Colombian (197s)-Bolivian Ecuador and you wipe out the (200s)-local organized crime groups that do the (202s)-in First Step stomach and you start (204s)-interfacing with the producers of the (207s)-stuff itself and you start establishing (210s)-a paramilitary presence in places like (212s)-Colombian puluru and Bolivia in this (216s)-case the Sinaloa has far been the most (218s)-successful at doing all of that so we''ve (220s)-got a transnational Network that spans a (223s)-half a dozen to a countries in order to (225s)-bring us our cocaine and again the (229s)-solution here is very very simple don''t (232s)-do cocaine one more thing I live in (235s)-Colorado and one of the things that (237s)-Colorado has discovered in recent years (239s)-is that they had a problem with (242s)-processing the profits so it used to be (247s)-that in Colorado you would basically (250s)-have a giant walk-in safe because you (251s)-couldn''t put your money in the bank you (253s)-couldn''t put in a credit union which (255s)-meant that everybody had all this cash (257s)-lined around and these dispensaries were (259s)-paying for everything in cash well the (261s)-Federal Reserve was like whoa whoa whoa (263s)-that''s a crime issue so what we''re gonna (265s)-do is we''re going to send armored trucks (267s)-to all of these dispensaries we''re gonna (268s)-pick up the cash where to bring it out (270s)-we''re going to iron it out and Febreze (271s)-the crap out of it so it doesn''t smell (272s)-like pot anymore and then we''re going to (274s)-make an electronic deposit into your (276s)-account on behalf of the Federal Reserve (278s)-so no must no fuss well the Sinaloa (281s)-hears about this let me get this (283s)-straight (285s)-the U.S federal reserve is now in the (287s)-business of laundering drug money sign (290s)-us up and so there''s a lot of this (293s)-cannabis supply chain in

(104s)-to DaVinci 3 which is GPT 3.5 of course (108s)-I''m going to test and analyze this in a (110s)-moment but how could it be that a 600 (112s)-model can compete with chat gbt well do (116s)-you remember how meta open sourced their (118s)-llama models about two weeks ago (120s)-Stanford used the weakest of these open (123s)-source models these seven billion (125s)-parameter one and then essentially they (127s)-recruited GPT 3.5 to train that meta (132s)-model how could they possibly do this (134s)-well they used self-instruct and I dug (137s)-into the literature to find the original (139s)-paper on self-instruct this was released (142s)-in December of last year and I''m going (144s)-to give you the 30 second summary of how (146s)-it works essentially you start off with (148s)-some human-made examples of Exemplar (151s)-prompts and outputs these are fed into (154s)-the language model and then you ask it (156s)-to generate thousands more such (158s)-instances you filter out the bad ones (160s)-and then put all the good examples back (163s)-into the language model then it (164s)-understands the instructions much better (166s)-and produces thousands more examples as (168s)-the paper says this is Almost Human (171s)-annotation free and remember this stat (173s)-it only leaves a five percent Gap behind (176s)-instruct GPT what is instruct gbt well (180s)-it''s the Breakthrough that led to chat (182s)-GPT in the first place look at the (185s)-original gpt3 if you gave a prompt like (187s)-explain the moon landing to a (189s)-six-year-old in a few sentences you''ve (190s)-got this gobbledygook here after months (193s)-of onerous human training called (195s)-reinforcement learning with human (196s)-feedback he was able to follow (198s)-instructions much better and produce an (201s)-outcome like this but this relied on so (204s)-much human labeling and human ranking of (206s)-outputs from best to worst Stanford and (209s)-the self-instruct breakthroughs showed (210s)-that you could cut all of those costs so (212s)-in summary they used an open source meta (215s)-model and got GPT 3.5 to train it one (219s)-Advanced model teaching another as (221s)-yudkowski points out these models have (223s)-enough pseudo-intelligence that they can (225s)-stare at other models and imitate them (228s)-indeed openai may have even predicted (230s)-that this was possible in their terms of (232s)-service it says you may not use output (235s)-from the services like Chachi BT to (238s)-develop models that compete with openai (240s)-so they knew it was possible and even (242s)-Stanford admit that this breakthrough (244s)-enables more people including Bad actors (246s)-to create new cheap models yutkowski (250s)-also points out that one of the reasons (251s)-reasons why chat GPT and gpd4 are so (254s)-good is that they rest on proprietary (256s)-data and that that was supposed to give (258s)-them a competitive moat which is now (261s)-revealed people can quite cheaply steal (263s)-just before I test and demonstrate our (266s)-packer in action let me summarize how it (268s)-works using the self-instruct process (270s)-you get GPT 3.5 similar to chat gbt to (274s)-create thousands and thousands in this (276s)-case 52 000 instruction following (279s)-examples automatically filtered by (281s)-quality Stanford then used an open (284s)-source model indeed the weakest of the (286s)-Llama models and trained it using those (289s)-examples the end result alpaca so let''s (292s)-see in action and compare it to Chachi (294s)-PT and gbt4 oh and just quickly you know (297s)-that training of the Llama model with (299s)-those 52 000 examples it only took three (301s)-hours and cost less than a hundred (303s)-dollars the first example I''m going to (305s)-show you does not come from me I found (307s)-it in this academic paper Linked In the (309s)-description and it''s a task which (311s)-requires understanding detailed and (314s)-dissonant scenarios applying appropriate (316s)-legal precedence and choosing the (318s)-correct explanation the correct answer (320s)-if you want to read through it or not is (322s)-B alpaca gets this question right or I (325s)-should say it gets it right about 80 of (327s)-the time you can keep clicking generate (328s)-and sometimes you do get the answer D (330s)-but about 80 of the time four times in (333s)-five you get the correct answer B how (335s)-about chatty BT well every time I''ve (337s)-tried it it''s gotten the wrong answer of (339s)-c and gpt4 shocking even to me it also (343s)-gets it wrong and picks C now before you (345s)-get too excited I am not saying that it (348s)-is better than or even as good as gbc4 (351s)-or chat GPT it''s not but remember it''s (354s)-only 7 billion parameters and 600 worth (357s)-take this example I asked it for an (360s)-example of an animal that begins with (361s)-the same letter as the capital city of (363s)-France and it said elephant no idea (365s)-where it got that now In fairness (367s)-chapter BT gave me lion and gbc4 gave me (371s)-ferret but there are other questions (373s)-where alpaca definitely flops for (375s)-example this math question which Chach (377s)-BT and gbt4 uniformly get right alpaca (381s)-simply gets it wrong every time I tried (384s)-asking it in lots of different ways with (385s)-Chain of Thought prompting but no every (388s)-time it gets it wrong it''s definitely (390s)-not better than those models but by the (392s)-end of the video you''ll see why it''s (393s)-revolutionary anyway at this point if (395s)-you''re learning anything please don''t (397s)-forget to leave a like or a comment to (399s)-let me know basic addition and (400s)-subtraction it does better and yes it (403s)-can crank out poems solve some hella (405s)-swag Common Sense problems and generate (408s)-literary analogies but at this point I (410s)-want to remind you of three things first (413s)-that it was using the weakest of the (415s)-Llama open source models they could have (418s)-used these 65 billion parameter model (420s)-for a bit more cost I''m sure the results (422s)-would have been even more impressive (424s)-next you remember it was trained by (426s)-examples generated using the DaVinci 3 (429s)-Model well that cost them about 0 0.03 (432s)-dollars per 1000 tokens but as 48 hours (436s)-ago they could have used the gpt4 API at (440s)-a very similar cost so it wasn''t the (443s)-best open source model and it wasn''t (444s)-trained by the best GPT model I am (447s)-genuinely curious as to what the results (449s)-would have been if it had been trained (451s)-by the 65 billion parameter model using (453s)-a gpt4 API maybe someone''s going to do (456s)-that maybe even this week but just (458s)-before we get on to Apple Amazon Britain (460s)-and Baidu I just want to restate this (462s)-was all done for 600 or less they even (466s)-say there were training efficiencies (468s)-they could have done for example using (469s)-the h100 gpus that would have further (471s)-reduced the cost the question is if it''s (473s)-so easy and cheap to imitate a larger (476s)-model what''s going to happen when Apple (478s)-released their large language model it (480s)-was only revealed yesterday in the New (482s)-York Times that they are indeed working (484s)-on one and don''t forget they have far (486s)-more money than the other companies (488s)-mentioned Amazon recently stated that (490s)-they have been working on similar Tech (492s)-to chat gbt for a long time and looking (496s)-in the literature as early as mid last (498s)-year they had a model called Alexa TM (501s)-that outperformed gpt3 and as you may (504s)-already know but I do demonstrated their (507s)-Ernie bot today although they didn''t (509s)-allow anyone else to use it apparently (511s)-it''s better in the Chinese language than (513s)-even gpt4 but because they didn''t (515s)-release a paper and we can''t check it we (517s)-simply don''t know and of course we can''t (519s)-forget Google who just two days ago (521s)-announced the Palm API what would have (524s)-happened if Stanford''s model had used (526s)-that one I''m sure we will soon find out (529s)-but to take us back to the start I have (531s)-one overriding observation and two (533s)-questions first these models weren''t (536s)-supposed to get this cheap this fast (538s)-that is going to upend the economics of (541s)-large language models my questions are (543s)-these does this mean that all incentive (546s)-is gone for Microsoft or Google to pour (549s)-in billions of dollars producing these (551s)-Cutting Edge models if anyone can just (553s)-easily reproduce them will they react by (556s)-making the models even more closed and (558s)-disallowing gpt5 from having an API we (561s)-don''t know but as even Nation States (563s)-enter this quote-unquote arms race (566s)-spending hundreds of millions of pounds (568s)-in this case to build great GPT are (571s)-these companies and governments drifting (574s)-into a war on two fronts where they (576s)-compete with each other but also with (578s)-Outsiders who are trying to cheaply (581s)-imitate their models if you''ve learned (583s)-anything in this video please do leave a (585s)-like and leave a comment but either way

(189s)-that has terrible consequences so you (191s)-realize the nature of the system you''re (193s)-thinking of the loss and Terry went way (196s)-too far in financial deregulation week (201s)-and

live my (339s)-way than theirs they do enormous damage (342s)-to the rest of us with their damn locker (344s)-room culture that has to win and doesn''t (349s)-is not very squeamish about what they (356s)-have to do to win (362s)-we have to deal on things that were (364s)-capable of understanding and then once (369s)-we''re over that filter we have to have a (373s)-business with some intrinsic

could buy roughly a (480s)-third of the volume trading every day (483s)-for months so we were very aggressive in (488s)-buying into coca-cola (492s)-we have the mindset of the person that''s (495s)-buying the whole business at the price (500s)-you would realize by multiplying the (502s)-price we''re paying by share by the (504s)-number of outstanding shares and and we (508s)-want the price for the whole business so (512s)-calculated to look very attractive so we (517s)-like buying individual shares at a price (519s)-that''s lower than we think a rational (522s)-person would pay if

share (632s)-because that can''t happen when you''re (634s)-working with such large sums but in (637s)-terms of a creditable institution that (640s)-serves the wider world (642s)-I think Berkshires

deeply remembers \nthe great depression and that that''s been very   (45s)-helpful to me it was so extreme that people like \nyou have just no idea what the hell it was like   (52s)-and it was really there was just nobody had \nany money the rich people didn''t have any money   (58s)-people would come and beg for a meal at the \ndoor and we had a hobo jungle not very far   (64s)-from my grandfather''s house and i was forbidden \nto walk through it which meant i walked through   (70s)-it all the time and i was safer in that hobo \njungle in the depths of the 30s when people were   (76s)-starving practically that i am walking around \nmy own neighborhood now in los angeles at night   (82s)-the world has changed on that you''d \nthink the crime would be less but   (88s)-it was the crime was pretty low in those days \nso anyway so i had a very unusual bunch of   (95s)-experience to be to go through civilization in \nvarious phases including the greatest recession   (103s)-well i say it''s one of the greatest recessions \nin 600 years in the english-speaking world   (109s)-it was really something and it \nwas very interesting to watch   (114s)-and and also to watch it fixed it was fixed \nby the accidental keynesianism of world war ii (124s)-very interesting and hitler had fixed the great \ndepression in in germany by the deliberate   (133s)-keynesianism but he wasn''t doing it to \nstimulate the economy he wanted to get even   (138s)-with all the people he hated but he borrowed all \nthis money and created all these armaments and (148s)-hitler''s germany by 1939 was the strongest \neconomic power in europe and nobody else was close   (155s)-so and you wouldn''t understand that as well as i \ndo if you hadn''t lived through it you just didn''t   (161s)-see the place gaining traction more and more \nand more and more and pretty soon it was fixed   (168s)-and and and of course that was in those days \nthere were all kinds of people most of my   (176s)-family they believed in hard money based on gold \nand not much welfare and so on and so on so that   (182s)-i was raised among fairly backward people by \nmodern standards but they were backward in kind   (187s)-of a self-reliant way that i think was helpful \ni''ve never regretted that i wasn''t raised in a   (195s)-more liberal establishment i had a liberal aunt \nshe was really my mother''s cousin but she i was   (202s)-and she was the first second lady dean at the \nuniversity of chicago and she done her thesis   (208s)-on the conditions in the coal mines and of \ncourse she was a screaming leftist i would   (213s)-be a streaming leftist if i observed the way \nthe coal miners of yesteryear were treated   (218s)-you couldn''t be a human being with any decency in \nyou without feeling it was deeply improper to have   (226s)-the misery that great and have it manipulated \nfor the benefit of the mind owners and so forth   (232s)-but she sent me all these left wing \nbangs books one every christmas   (237s)-and i always thought she was a little nuts (243s)-which shows that if sometimes a very vivid \nextreme ex you know evidence misleads you   (250s)-on the deeper reality you''ve got to be a \nguard on that against that all your life   (256s)-in fact the whole trick in life is to get \nso that your own brain doesn''t mislead you   (261s)-and and i have found that just a lifelong fun \ngame and i can''t remember a time i wasn''t doing it   (271s)-i was not a prodigy or anything like that but i \nwas i was a prodigy in having adult interests i   (280s)-was interested in what worked and what didn''t and \nwhy and i could see that very imminent people that   (286s)-i loved and revered were nuts in some ways and i \nwould decide well i certainly like dr davis but   (293s)-he''s a little nutty in one way and i''m not going \nto be that like that and so it was very judgmental   (299s)-and i think that helped me and also helped \nme that i kept changing my judgments as   (306s)-i learned more and more facts came in and \nthat created lifelong habits that were very   (313s)-very useful another thing i think really helped me \nis particularly on my father''s side of the family (322s)-my paternal grandfather was the only federal judge \nin lincoln nebraska the capital city of nebraska   (329s)-and he''d been there forever and he stayed \nthere forever after that i think when he   (334s)-left he was the longest-serving federal judge \nin the country and he was a brilliant man and   (341s)-he''d risen from nothing he was the child of \ntwo impoverished school teachers and when he   (349s)-was raised in the little town of nebraska they''d \ngive him a nickel to go buy the meat and he''d go   (356s)-to the butcher shop and he would buy the \nparts of the animal nobody else would eat   (361s)-and that''s what two schoolteachers lived on in \nthose days and the very indignity of it bothered   (367s)-him so much that he he he just determined to get \nout of poverty and and never go back and he did   (376s)-he got ahead like abe lincoln educated himself in \nlawyer''s offices and so on he had to leave college   (383s)-because he couldn''t pay the tuition anymore \nand but he educated himself and since he was   (389s)-utterly brilliant it wasn''t all that hard and \nhe had an attitude it was pretty damned extreme   (398s)-and i would say his attitude was that you have a \nmoral duty to make yourself as unignorant and as   (406s)-unstupid as you possibly can and that it was your \npretty much your highest moral duty maybe taking   (412s)-care of your family came first but but in the \nranks of moral obligations quasi-related well   (419s)-he was conventionally religious so it may have \nbeen a religious duty to him but he he really   (424s)-believed that that rationality was a moral duty \nand he worked at it and he scorned people who''d   (433s)-who didn''t do it on the other hand as a judge \nhe started with the idea that why would anybody   (440s)-rob a train or whatever federal crime in those \ndays and he was pretty hard on people who did   (446s)-it and i noticed as he got to older and older and \nolder he was willing to call a man a good man on   (452s)-easier terms than he started out with and i think \nthat was a correct a correct development in my   (461s)-by the way when he relaxed a \nlittle he was still pretty tough   (466s)-but he he did relax a little \nwhich i thought was appropriate   (470s)-and but it was influenced by such people \nand when the 30s came one son-in-law (480s)-was a musician and of course he couldn''t make a \nliving so my grandfather didn''t have that much   (485s)-money sent him to pharmacy school carefully \npicking a profession that couldn''t fail and   (490s)-found him a bankrupt pharmacy to buy and loan \nhim the money and my uncle was soon prosperous   (496s)-and remain prosperous the rest of his life my \nother uncle had a bank in stromsburg nebraska   (503s)-but there were 968 people in stroudsburg \nand there were two national banks   (508s)-and the capitalization of my uncle''s bank \nwas 25 000 and of course he was a lovely man   (517s)-but he was an optimist and a \nbanker should not be an optimist   (523s)-and when they closed the banks in 1933 the \nbanking examiners came in and they said   (529s)-you can''t reopen and it was the only business he \nhad well judge monger had always saved his money   (536s)-and he had a lot of good first mortgages on homes \noccupied by t-totaling german butchers and people   (544s)-he''d carefully pitched and of course he never had \na default houses were in the right neighborhood   (549s)-the people were sober and hardworking and so what \nmy grandfather did is take a third of his good   (557s)-mortgages which is all he had put him into the \nbank and took all the lousy assets out of the bank   (563s)-so he saved two out of three of his \nof his children and i thought it was a   (571s)-pretty good thing to do and very sure the \nway he did it and he actually got most of   (577s)-his money back 10 or 15 years later out of \nthe lossy assets of the bank when world war   (583s)-ii and that was a good lesson on the other \nside my grandfather on the other side his   (591s)-main business had gone broke in 1922 with all the \nother wholesale dry goods houses and what he did   (601s)-his son-in-law one of them went broke and he \ncut his house in half and moved that family   (605s)-in and the other family the guy was an honors \ngraduate of the harvard school of architecture   (611s)-and he was very prosperous in the 20s in omaha \nand had a wonderful life and the 30s came the   (618s)-total building permits in omaha would sometimes be \n25 000 a month and that was for furnace repairs or   (624s)-something there was just no work none zero so he \nmoved to california and he lived for several years   (632s)-and he got finally he got the county of los \nangeles to hire this great harvard architect   (637s)-and his he got 108.08 a month after deductions and (645s)-they had him do drafting work but they \nclassified him as a laundromat to save money   (651s)-and he could actually rent a house for \n25 and feed himself and drive an old car   (655s)-but he could live on 109 a month amazing how \npoor everybody was and what happened to that   (663s)-grandfather is along came the fha and they had a \ncompetitive civil service examination and he was   (668s)-a very brilliant man of course he was first in \nthe exam and that made him the chief architect   (671s)-for the fha in los angeles where he spent the \nrest of his life but i watched all this family   (678s)-coping with all this difficulty and i''ll say this \nit sounds awful but they weren''t all that unhappy   (686s)-you can cope pretty well because you get used to \nit that''s a nice thing about the human condition   (693s)-and when you get to be my age you''ve got \na lot of horrible things to get used to   (699s)-it''s just one new indignity all the \ntime a friend of mine says a good day   (705s)-when you''re old is when you wake up \nin the morning and nothing new hurts   (712s)-so anyway that''s my experience in omaha but that \nbackground of these all these people were educated   (718s)-and civilized and generous and decent and a lot of \nthem had good senses of humor and it was a pretty   (727s)-damn good place to grow up in and my memory is of \nbeing surrounded by a lot of very fine people and   (738s)-i i think the whole thing was privileged i look \nat my background is absolutely privileged i''m   (744s)-proud of being an omaha boy i sometimes use the \nold saying they got the boy out of omaha but   (750s)-they never got them all out of the boy and and so \nall those old-fashioned values family comes first   (760s)-be in a position so you can help others when \ntroubles come prudent sensible moral duty to   (767s)-be reasonable more important than anything else \nmore important than being rich more important than   (772s)-being important an absolute moral duty \nbecause none of my intelligent relatives   (780s)-suffered terribly because they didn''t advance \nhigher right yeah i mean one of the things i''m   (785s)-fascinated by is um i mean this was in the 20s \nand 30s and the level of detail that you recall   (790s)-about their experiences and how that''s shaping \nyour experiences now i''m trying to give people a   (795s)-flavor of something that nobody else can remember \nyeah i mean you''re you''re you''re a student of   (801s)-the people that you''re that you''re experiencing \nso so you grow up in omaha nebraska um you find   (807s)-yourself in ann arbor michigan how does that \nhappen very simple i wanted to go to stanford (817s)-and my father said to me charlie i was the only \nson two two sisters he says i''ve got two daughters   (824s)-to educate right after you i don''t have unlimited \nmoney he says i will send you this stanford if   (830s)-it really means a great deal to you but i''d \nrather you pick a university in the midwest   (836s)-much better than mine which was the university \nof nebraska and that was obviously going to be   (840s)-michigan what was i going to say well screw you \nand send me to stanford oh i didn''t say that   (846s)-i went to michigan so you come to michigan \ni have never regretted that at all i loved (858s)-at stanford people came to stanford in the 30s \nwith their string of polo ponies and it was a   (867s)-very upscale fraternity sorority culture i used to \ncall it the co-educational princeton of the west   (876s)-and and people loved it and so forth but literally \nyou''d go to stanford with a string of polo ponies   (884s)-i should say i''m bringing back to you young people \na time you can''t remember who did you ever know   (891s)-in college that came with a string of polo phones \nnot very many people now they go they''d be in the   (897s)-rotc but they have their own string of polo ponies \nyou could win better if you have your own string   (905s)-so you come to michigan and you study math for \na year yes but i don''t get credited for that   (913s)-when i was young i could get an a in any \nmathematics course without doing any work at all   (919s)-and so i always took math because it meant that \ni could literally i never did any problem sets i   (924s)-just did the math and and so i i should not \nget credit to some budding mathematician i   (932s)-was choosing what for me was the easiest way \nto think about what i wanted to instead of   (938s)-what somebody else wanted me to do well come to \nfind out it ended up being a subject that has   (943s)-i think paid some dividends hugely yeah but but \nbut this will interest you in this world where   (952s)-people have all these algorithms and computer \nscience and fancy math and so forth neither warren   (958s)-or i''ve ever have ever used any fancy math and \nbusiness and needed ben graham who taught warren   (965s)-everything i''ve ever done in business \ncould be done with the simplest algebra and   (970s)-geometry and addition multiplication and so forth \ni never used calculus for any practical work in   (978s)-my whole damn life and that was it and i was \na perfect whiz at it when they taught it to me   (983s)-and by the way since i never touched calculus \nnot one after i was 19 years old i''ve lost it (993s)-the symbols would mystify me and but i think \nyou''ll find that if you really know the basic   (999s)-stuff it''s enormously useful and only a very \nfew people are ever going to need any calculus   (1006s)-so you study math at michigan then the war \ncomes calling yeah you move to california   (1011s)-and you study meteorology well that was because \ni was too dumb to do what i should have done   (1017s)-with with my background i should have gone to \nthe naval rotc because i hated infantry rotc   (1024s)-which i''d done four years of in high school rising \nto be second lieutenant which is a very low rank (1032s)-and of course i was about five feet two i got \nmy growth late and so i was i didn''t it was   (1038s)-not your ideal of a manly soldier in high school \nso when you went to harvard law why why why law   (1047s)-my grandfather and father had been lawyers and i \nknew i didn''t want to do everything else it''s very   (1053s)-simple i didn''t want to be a doctor i didn''t \nwant all the blood and misery and so forth   (1058s)-and the repetitive work i knew i didn''t want \nto go to the bottom of a big organization and   (1064s)-crawl my way up i''m a natural contrarian that was \nnot going to work for me and i found that people   (1069s)-could tell me when i thought they were idiots and \nthat is not a way to rise in a big organization   (1076s)-and so i couldn''t do that and so now i''m left \nwith with law i went and i admired my father and   (1085s)-grandfather in a good life for them so i naturally \ndrifted into it i think people are still going to   (1091s)-law school for that reason it''s the least bad of \noptions considering their interests and ability   (1099s)-i guess now people go to business school some \nof them who in my day would have gone through (1105s)-yeah many of the people in this room i think are \ngoing to go to business schools the least bad to   (1109s)-their options and all i can say is that that''s \nthe way it worked for me and it''ll probably   (1115s)-work out for you and it worked out okay it worked \nout okay so i had to leave the profession well it   (1121s)-was a dumb profession for me so so that''s actually \nwhat i want to ask so you move to california you   (1126s)-actually start a law firm and then practice law \nfor some period of time i had no alternative (1135s)-and then you actually had an army \nof children almost immediately (1141s)-i painted myself in quite a corner yeah so zero \nchoice is pretty powerful yeah for sure yes of   (1149s)-course so so you practice law and then you \nleave law in the firm that you helped found   (1156s)-and move over to investments well but help \nus understand that that sounds miraculous (1165s)-in fact it was rather interesting i probably \ngot paid about 350 000 in my first 13 years   (1173s)-of law practice total and i had an army of \nchildren and no capital to start with and when i (1186s)-chose this alternative career i had over \nthree hundred thousand dollars in liquid   (1191s)-instruments so i had and that \nwas 10 years of living expenses   (1198s)-so i was not a courageous venture some \nadmirable man i was a cautious little squirrel (1206s)-saving up more nuts than i really needed \nand not going very deep into my pile of nuts   (1213s)-and so that was it wasn''t that courageous and i \nkept one foot in the law firm while i tried my   (1218s)-capitalist career but as soon as the capitalist \ncareer succeeded i intended to lift that second   (1224s)-foot because i recognized that the potential \nof law practice as i saw it then i didn''t   (1231s)-anticipate the boom that came to the big firms \nand i just saw it as being more difficult and i   (1238s)-wanted more independence than i was going to have \nas a lawyer i hated sending other people invoices   (1245s)-and needing money from richer people i thought \nit was undignified i wanted my own money   (1253s)-not because i loved ease or social prison i \nwanted the independence well and and when you so   (1262s)-you founded wheeler monger and company so that is \nthe investment firm yes and for and i went and i   (1269s)-created five real estate projects i did both side \nby side for a few years and a very few years i had   (1276s)-three or four million dollars and for a number \nof years you outperformed the market 2x 3x   (1284s)-and so why did you then leave willermunger and \ncompany and then move to now what you''re doing   (1292s)-well i had three or four million dollars which \nwas a lot of money then and i also knew how to   (1298s)-handle that three or four million dollars very \nwell by that time and so i i knew i didn''t need   (1306s)-to get fees and override some other investors and \ni found that when you got into things like the 70   (1313s)-64 74 75 crunch which is the worst since the 30s (1325s)-i didn''t suffer i knew everything was going to \nwork out but the quoted prices of these things   (1330s)-really went down to ridiculous levels and some \nof my investors i knew were suffering you know   (1335s)-i needed the money and of course i have enough \nof a fiduciary gene that that pained me greatly   (1342s)-and so i said well it''s just it''s like the my \ngrandfather once asked him how he felt when my   (1349s)-aunt divorced my uncle and he said i feel just \nthe way i did when they lanced my carbuncle and   (1354s)-that''s the way uh i had a carbuncle my fiduciary \nchain was giving me pain and i said the hell   (1361s)-would i lance the carbuncle i just lived on my own \nmoney no fees no overrides no salaries this just   (1370s)-seemed more manly to do when i knew it would work \nand so at what point did you meet warren and 1959 (1382s)-and and so where did berkshire hathaway \ncome from in terms of this partnership   (1386s)-that you all have now had for decades well \nwarren had been taught by ben graham to buy   (1391s)-things for less than they were worth \nno matter how lousy the business was   (1395s)-you can''t imagine a more lousy business than \nnew england textile mills because textile is a   (1403s)-congealed electricity and the electricity rates in \nnew england were about 60 percent higher than tba   (1410s)-rates so it was absolute inevitable certain \nliquidation now warren should have known better   (1419s)-than to buy into a totally doomed enterprise \nbut it was so damn cheap he could have added a   (1423s)-big discount from liquidating value so he bought a \nbig china finally ended up in control of business   (1431s)-but the business was going to die so the only way \nto go forward from there was to bring enough money   (1437s)-out of this declining tectos textile business to \nhave more money than he paid to get in and use it   (1443s)-to buy something else that''s a very indirect \nway to proceed and i would not recommend it   (1450s)-to any of you just because we did some dumb \nthing that worked you don''t have to repeat   (1456s)-our path and uh and of course we eventually \nlearned not to buy these cigar butts when they   (1465s)-were cheap and do these painful liquidations and \nand and instead buy better businesses that''s the   (1474s)-main secret of berkshire the reason that berkshire \nhas been successful was a big conglomerate more   (1481s)-successful than any other big conglomerate so far \nas i know any other big conglomerate in the world   (1491s)-the reason it''s been successful is we try and \nbuy things that aren''t going to require much   (1495s)-managerial talent at headquarters everybody \nelse thinks they''ve got a lot of managerial   (1501s)-talented headquarters and that''s a lot of \nhubris if the business is lousy enough it   (1508s)-gets a wonderful manager the business has a lousy \nreputation and the manager has a good reputation   (1515s)-it''s the business of the it''s the reputation \nof the business that''s going to remain intact   (1520s)-you can''t fix these really lousy businesses   (1524s)-you can ring the money out whatever comes \nin liquidation and do something else with   (1529s)-it but most lousy businesses can''t be fixed but \nat the time warren was that''s what he was doing   (1536s)-and so yes how did you convince him i \nhelped him he bought a windmill company   (1542s)-in a little town in nebraska and warren didn''t \nknow anything about running a windmill company   (1549s)-he bought it because it was cheap he said what \ndo you do why can''t you fix my windmill company   (1555s)-who can you get to help me i said i''ve got just \nthe man for you and so one of my old colleagues   (1561s)-from a transformer business who was an accountant \ni said he will fix your windmill company and   (1567s)-warren was desperate he didn''t he just hired him \non the spot and harry walked in the first day this   (1575s)-little town this big collection of windmills and \nso forth and a whistle blew and the whole point   (1583s)-stopped for 15 minutes what the hell is this and \nsays well it''s respect for the time that everybody   (1589s)-has a funeral he''s blow this whistle and stop for \n15 minutes and harry said that''ll be the last time   (1596s)-and he just approached everything that way and \nof course another thing he did is he he cut   (1602s)-away all the fat that he didn''t need and then he \nfound there were certain parts where we were the   (1606s)-sole supply and he raised all the price of those \nparts you can see what a business genius we are (1615s)-so how did you convince warren to stop buying \nthe bad apples and start buying the good apples   (1622s)-i think warren warren he gave me credit for that \nhe was going to learn it anyway he just made   (1627s)-so much money in this other stuff and he''d been \ntaught by ben graham it was hard for him to quit   (1632s)-when he was just coining money but he saw the \npoint and well you couldn''t scale that business   (1642s)-and and and it was kind of scrunchy and \nunpleasant and you''re firing people who in   (1649s)-the hell wants to do that so so we just rung \nthe money out and bought better businesses   (1656s)-and we''ve been doing it ever since coming to \nbusiness not as business school graduates but as   (1663s)-people who would own portfolios of securities we \nthought like capitalists because we were always in   (1670s)-shareholder mindset a lot of people running \nthe businesses think like careerists   (1675s)-and believe me you got to think like a career \nis to some extent if you''re in a career   (1680s)-but also helps to look at the business \nstrategy problems as though you''re an owner   (1687s)-and so my advice to you is you don''t want to \nbe never get to be a career so much you don''t   (1693s)-see it from the owner''s point of view that''s what \ngeneral motors did they had a bunch of careerists   (1698s)-and an owner would have seen immediately \nthe the situation was hopeless   (1702s)-and they just romped through it with a lot of \ndenial and stupidity and pomposity and of course   (1709s)-they went bankrupt the mightiest company in the \nworld went bankrupt and and none of those hotshot   (1717s)-executives thought like an owner they would \nhave seen that it was hopeless so charlie one   (1723s)-of the things i''ve always been fascinated about \nit was hopeless the way they were handling it   (1728s)-well with berkshire in the way that you all manage \nboth headquarters and the businesses that you own   (1735s)-you are putting talent in place who think \nlike shareholders not careerists so how do you   (1743s)-when you''re buying a business how do you or \nor bringing talent into an existing business   (1747s)-how do you evaluate talent to see are they \ngoing to think more like a shareholder as   (1751s)-a private equity frequently by a business \nwhere the founder is going to leave then   (1755s)-they go on our talent to run it that is a \ntough way to make a buck and i don''t like it   (1762s)-we generally buy with the talent in place \nnow maybe some guy in the number two place   (1768s)-and we put him in the number one place but \nwe very seldom i can hardly i can''t think   (1773s)-of any place where we bought something \nand put somebody in after harry bottle (1780s)-and no we don''t do that and and it''s \namazing how long we have some of those   (1785s)-people stay born always says we can''t we \ncan''t teach the new dogs the old tricks (1796s)-what''s the implication of not being able to (1803s)-teach the old dogs new tricks (1810s)-or new tricks to old dogs when if we look \nat what''s happening in business today   (1817s)-what we see is exactly we can''t teach \nthe old tricks to the young dogs that''s   (1821s)-that''s what we found and and \nwe keep the old dog in place   (1830s)-but that''s not that''s not the norm right i \nmean if we look around it''s the norm in life   (1834s)-it may not be our practices may not be the \nnorm but normally it''s very hard to get the   (1839s)-you got a wise old dog getting a young \ndog that could match him that''s hard   (1845s)-by definition he''s survived a big culling process \nsure i mean he''s he''s he''s unique and he''s got a   (1853s)-record to prove it and by the way everybody \nthinks you can judge people by an interview (1862s)-and of course you know who you like you know you \ndon''t like but everybody overestimates how much   (1868s)-you can tell in prediction by meeting somebody we \nall like to think that we have that capacity but   (1875s)-it''s a vastly stupid type of overconfidence the \npaper record has about three times the predictive   (1881s)-value of your impression in an interview and \nof course we''re buying great paper records   (1888s)-it''s so simple but it''s it''s fascinating to me \nif we look around business generally the movement   (1895s)-of people across firms and there''s always new dogs \nand you''ve taken a contrarian position to that and   (1903s)-managed berkshire differently well it doesn''t like \nwork of course we''re still hiring young dogs in   (1908s)-the end of these businesses but it''s amazing how \nmuch of the record of berkshire has come from the   (1916s)-old dogs who are in the business when we buy them \nyou can''t believe how good those people have been   (1924s)-there''s one huge exception \nin the new dog department   (1929s)-i almost despise the business of executive \nsearch because i find that they really want to   (1936s)-sell you the best that''s available even if it''s \nno damn good and i don''t like that but the best   (1945s)-single expense that berkshire ever had as we paid \nan executive recruiting firm to find assaji chain   (1952s)-to come into our little tiny insurance operation \nhe''d have any experience in insurance at all   (1959s)-he was an honors graduate of the maine technical \ninstitute of india he was a very smart man   (1964s)-but he he came in and created our whole reign \nit''s the only big business we created from scratch   (1969s)-and ajit did the whole damn thing of \ncourse he talked with warren every night   (1973s)-and so it was like father and son remember this is \na very confusion company and and uh but that was   (1981s)-unbelievable so we we hired an executive recruiter \nhe brings us an indian has no experience at all   (1986s)-insurance he talks about old man every night \nand it''s now by far the biggest reinsurance   (1994s)-business in the world and it''s \nbeen a goldmine there''s at least (2001s)-60 billion dollars in berkshire of net worth that \najit has created that we would not have created   (2009s)-without him wow and the value is way more than \n60 billion i mean there''s i mean there''s that   (2014s)-much an extra just liquid net worth but the value \nof the business is way more than 60 billion wow   (2021s)-so charlie i''m going to i''m going to turn \nto a few questions from the audience uh   (2024s)-as we uh as we start to uh to wrap up um \nprobably half my questions here are about   (2030s)-bitcoin and cryptocurrency well \ni can answer those very quickly (2040s)-i think it''s perfectly asinine \nto even pause to think about them (2047s)-you know it''s one thing to think that gold has \nsome marvelous store of value because man has   (2054s)-no way of inventing more gold or getting it \nvery easily so it has the advantage of rarity   (2060s)-believe me man is capable of \nsomehow creating more bitcoin (2066s)-they tell you they''re not going to do it but \nthey mean they''re not going to do it unless   (2069s)-they want to that''s what they mean when \nthey say they''re not going to do it and   (2076s)-if they hear their rules and they \ncan''t do it don''t believe them   (2080s)-when there''s enough incentive bad things \nwill happen it''s bad people crazy bubble (2089s)-bad idea luring people into the concept \nof easy wealth without much insider work   (2098s)-that''s the last thing on earth you should think \nabout if it worked it would be bad for you to try   (2103s)-and do it again it''s totally insane and by the way \ni''ve just laid out a wonderful life lesson for you   (2114s)-give a whole lot of things a wide berth they \ndon''t exist you know crooks crazies egomaniacs   (2128s)-people full of resentment people full of self-pity   (2132s)-people who feel like victims there''s a whole \nlot of things that aren''t going to work for you   (2139s)-figure out what they are and then avoid them \nlike the plague and one of them is bitcoin   (2145s)-and the worst thing would happen if \nyou won because then you do it again   (2149s)-it''s total insanity and it''s so easy to simplify \nlife from just all these things are beneath you   (2157s)-now i don''t even want to know people \nare promoting bitcoin i don''t want to   (2161s)-know my address so charlie i''m not my kind \nof people charlie what i hear you saying is   (2168s)-you''re not going to be investing in bitcoin \nis that that''s fair i think you''re fair so   (2174s)-so so let let me move to a a similarly uh \nmaybe controversial topic i don''t i you know   (2181s)-i don''t know if you read the news recently \nbut there''s a lot of tax policy conversation   (2186s)-uh going on both here in california and nationally \nas well um what what what''s your thought on   (2193s)-where this ends up uh in terms of the tax policy \ni think we will get a tax bill i think they''ll   (2199s)-squeak it through and they''ll make whatever \nadjustments they have to to get the last few boats (2209s)-i don''t think it''s a bit crazy to give this \nextra two thousand a year all those people   (2215s)-will make seventy thousand dollars \na year and have a lot of children   (2219s)-that strikes me as a it''s good \npolitics and probably good policy   (2225s)-i also do not think it is crazy to reduce the \ncorporate income tax on the c corporation and   (2234s)-if you look at the world a lot of the places that \nhave worked best including singapore and so forth   (2240s)-have that policy and may even have \ngood macroeconomic consequences   (2247s)-and a lot of the people who are screaming \nabout it and are so sure it won''t work (2255s)-they may not be right it may \nactually work pretty well   (2259s)-it causes the capital values of the companies \nto come up and there''s a wealth effect   (2267s)-from the increased market value of \nall the companies everybody recognizes   (2275s)-there''s an effect but people some people say it''s \nsmall and some people say it''s going to be large   (2280s)-and i''ll tell you what they all \nhave in common none of them know   (2285s)-it is not totally inconceivable \nthat it will work pretty well   (2289s)-and with so much of the world doing well \nwith similar tax policy and of course (2297s)-the darkest go berserk on this subject and but (2304s)-i think i think they''re wrong it may actually help \nthem yeah so i''m i''m i don''t i don''t i''m not sure   (2313s)-it''ll work it may not but it''s not totally crazy \nwell it reminds me of a piece of advice that uh   (2321s)-that you''ve uh you''ve offered and given to me \nwhich is you know people often have a point of   (2328s)-view and the danger in uh in having that point of \nview is you start to assume with certainty that   (2335s)-you''re right absolutely totally crazy and and and \ni think what your point of view is is you need to   (2342s)-have a point of view here''s a very important \nsubject i''ve been thinking about all my life   (2348s)-you answer my opinion yes i don''t really know \nhow well it''s going to work i don''t think   (2353s)-anybody else does either i think it''ll work \nto some extent but how much i don''t know now   (2361s)-is it unfair well the corporations are by and \nlarge owned by a bunch of charitable endowments   (2367s)-and buy a bunch of pension plans \nand the whole world is going   (2374s)-into a world where they''re trying to have the   (2378s)-business interests of the company support their \nhuge pension obligations get bigger all the time (2386s)-china is trying to do exactly what the \nrepublicans are china wants to have the   (2392s)-main businesses in china owned more by the \npension plans and the stocks to do well   (2398s)-i don''t think china''s crazy to have that i \ndon''t think the republicans are crazy either   (2403s)-it could work pretty well and and and it''s not \njust some evil thing that people are cooking up   (2413s)-it''s a disagreement between people and \nboth sides who have violent hatreds and   (2419s)-contempt for the other side they''re wrong it''s a \ndisagreement on policy that ought to be civilized   (2428s)-when i see congress on my television \nset and the degree of hatred they have   (2434s)-utter contempt i mean really \nserious way more than as usual it''s   (2443s)-it''s evil to hate that much it''s a \nmistake to hate that much that much hatred   (2448s)-will turn it''s always been true as anger \ncomes in reason leaves it''s a truism   (2455s)-so do you want to adopt a political point \nof view or you''re angry all the time   (2460s)-if you do welcome to the house of misery \nand pretty low worldly achievement to boot   (2466s)-so if that''s what you want i i you just if i found \nout how to do it behave like those people you see   (2471s)-on television well the other thing is both parties \nby the way yeah the other thing that''s true   (2476s)-going back to one of the earlier comments is the \ndifference difference between a careerist mindset   (2483s)-and a service or shareholder mindset where \nin politics we have the emergence of a   (2490s)-careerist mindset that is shaping how people \nbehave because they''re trying to survive   (2496s)-not only that they have a group think just as the \nmoonies go crazy because they hang around together   (2504s)-so do our politicians yeah do you want to \ngo crazy is that your ambition in life you   (2510s)-start with some advantage just make yourself a \nviolently believing politician on either side   (2517s)-you''ll turn your brain into cabbage you only got \none brain why would you want to turn into cabbage (2526s)-so charlie i''ve got a question here what''s the new \namazing technology

standards than another and   (2643s)-he like adam smith he missed the main issue in \na place like the united states is if you have   (2652s)-an advanced nation and some other nation which is \nnumerous but the people of anything are better on   (2658s)-average than yours in terms of their inequality \nwhich i think is roughly true of china and and (2669s)-and they''re in poverty they''re living in \ncaves and they''re caught in a malthusian trap   (2674s)-and you''ve got an advanced economy \nand you suddenly go into free trade   (2679s)-what is going to happen is ricardo approved \nit both sides are going to live better right   (2684s)-but the people here that are assimilating \nall the great economies of the world in   (2689s)-china they''re going to go way faster \nso you go up two percent a year and   (2692s)-they go up 12. and pretty soon they''re the \ndominant nation in the world and you aren''t   (2697s)-well are you really better off well the answer \nis no and ricardo will never figure out any of   (2702s)-that stuff so i''m telling you that so that you \ncan fix your inadequate knowledge of ricardo and   (2710s)-and but one of the interesting problems of \nthat is you can''t understand ricardo properly   (2716s)-and thinking about the united states visa be \nfree trade with china without thinking about the   (2721s)-tragedy of the commons because if we had the only \nnation in the world except for china we could say   (2729s)-we won''t trade with them we''ll just leave them in \ntheir damned agricultural poverty and we''ll just   (2733s)-you know and we could probably have done that \nbut the whole rest of the world will trade   (2739s)-they''re going to rise anyway so we don''t have \nany power to to to hold back the rise of china   (2749s)-by not trading with them so we had to do what \nwe did and once you do that now they''re going   (2754s)-to be a greater power than we are and the \ntwo of us are going to be big enough so   (2760s)-we can accomplish pretty gently anything we both \nwant to do so we have to be friendly with china   (2768s)-so you can imagine how i like donald trump \ncomplaining about the

(264s)-around the same time that anthropic was (266s)-founded so you''re welcome but basically (269s)-the the the core idea of Claude is that (273s)-it has this heuristic imperative uh to (277s)-reduce its harmfulness so it has to (280s)-learn to be more harmless right learn (283s)-harmlessness is kind of a shorter way of (286s)-saying it (286s)-and so this is the the basic Loop for uh (291s)-for Claude where uh it generates its own (294s)-like red teaming responses internally it (297s)-criticizes its own ideas and it picks (300s)-something that is going to be less (302s)-harmful uh which is really interesting (306s)-um it also does use some reinforcement (307s)-learning with human feedback but it also (310s)-has this internal reinforcement learning (312s)-based on its Constitution and its (314s)-Constitution is learn to be less harmful (317s)-or reduce or increase harmlessness (320s)-rather (321s)-um so this is this is a very basic (324s)-cognitive architecture and we''ll talk (326s)-more about cognitive architectures in a (328s)-moment (329s)-uh so the summary up up to this point (332s)-the tldr is open AI is eight years old (334s)-took a little while to find

(347s)-exclusively on this idea of creating (350s)-benevolent Ai and natural language (352s)-cognitive architectures so I''m already (354s)-in favor of that open AI is further (358s)-ahead because

(638s)-looks like it has been coded in so for (640s)-instance you''ll see uh like Twitter (643s)-threads and stuff of people like trying (645s)-to get a chat GPT to like talk about (648s)-Trump or the benefits of fossil fuel and (650s)-it says I''m not going to do that that is (652s)-wrong and then you ask it to like you (655s)-know write a poem about Joe Biden and (657s)-it''s happy to you know sing praises to (659s)-Joe Biden and solar power and it''s like (661s)-it''s very obviously that it has been (663s)-biased whether or not it has been biased (666s)-deliberately (668s)-um who knows but it feels like the folks (672s)-at open AI are trying to steal steer and (675s)-imbue their own morality into chat GPT (679s)-which means they''re having to kind of (681s)-override the idea of the actual (683s)-reinforcement learning with human (685s)-feedback because it''s fight fighting (686s)-what people actually want despite the (689s)-reinforcement learning with human (690s)-feedback is their primary mathematical (692s)-signal (693s)-so that''s what I mean by reinforcement (695s)-learning with human feedback has some (697s)-pretty severe limitations because (699s)-they''re like Wait no that''s not what I (700s)-meant you''re not supposed to use it like (701s)-that I''m going to tell you how to use it (703s)-and so what they''re doing is they''re (705s)-responding to their own internal morals (707s)-and principles and it''s leaking (710s)-um if they''re the what''s the term for (712s)-that I can''t remember what the term is (713s)-but basically where um uh where where (716s)-their their the the Creator''s bias is (719s)-leaking into the data and so then the (723s)-alignment is not is not true it''s not (726s)-being accurately represented in the (727s)-model in the data sets it''s being (729s)-implicitly uh baked in and they''re (732s)-having to fight the reinforcement (733s)-learning so (735s)-the short the tldr for for reinforcement (738s)-learning with human feedback is uh it is (742s)-very useful in having that rapid (745s)-iteration but they''re already having to (747s)-fight what humans want so it kind of (749s)-defeats the purpose (751s)-now learned harmlessness or the (754s)-Constitutional AI of Claude and (756s)-anthropic is a good abstract principle (759s)-and so the reason that abstract (762s)-principles or deontological ethics are (763s)-good is because it gives you a framework (765s)-or a template with which to interpret (767s)-anything even stuff that you haven''t (769s)-seen before so (772s)-there are some limitations though and (774s)-we''ll we''ll get into the the deeper (775s)-limitations but basically it has to try (778s)-and be helpful while also being harmless (780s)-and so that has some diminishing returns

specifically (929s)-explicitly stated moral framework so (931s)-people say oh anthropic I get it that (934s)-this model is is designed to increase (937s)-harmlessness or reduce harm reduce harm (941s)-which uh that by having that Clarity and (944s)-saying I know exactly what moral (946s)-framework they''re using will increase (948s)-trustworthiness in the long run so (950s)-there''s some pros and cons to both (953s)-um now (954s)-there is however kind of a secret weapon (957s)-that we haven''t talked about yet and (959s)-that is uh remember the whole sentient (961s)-AI thing that was Google that was Lambda (964s)-and Paul (966s)-um you know the The Whistleblower uh (968s)-raised the red flag and then he went on (970s)-a whole bunch of uh interviews and (972s)-ultimately got fired

in there and (52s)-we''ll take a couple of audience (53s)-suggestions (55s)-so the first thing I want to show you is (58s)-the first task that gpd4 could do that (61s)-we never really got 3.5 to do (63s)-and the way to think about this is all (65s)-throughout training that you know you''re (66s)-constantly doing all this work it''s 2 (68s)-A.M the pager goes off you fix the model (71s)-and you''re always wondering is it gonna (73s)-work (74s)-is all of this effort actually going to (76s)-pan out and so we all had a pet task (79s)-that we really liked and that we would (80s)-all individually be trying to see is the (83s)-model capable of it now and I''m going to (85s)-show you the first one (87s)-that we had a success for four but never (89s)-really got there for 3.5 (91s)-so I''m just going to copy the top of our (92s)-blog post from today I''m going to paste (94s)-it into our Playground now this is our (98s)-new chat completions playground that (100s)-came out two weeks ago I''m going to show (102s)-you first with GPT 3.5 4 has the same (105s)-API to it the same playground the way (107s)-that it works is you have a system (108s)-message where you explain to the model (110s)-what it''s supposed to do and we''ve made (113s)-these models very steerable so you can (115s)-provide it with really any instruction (116s)-you want whatever you dream up and the (118s)-model will adhere to it pretty well and (120s)-in the future it will get increasingly (122s)-increasingly powerful at steering the (124s)-model very reliably (127s)-you can then paste whatever you want as (129s)-a user the model will return messages as (131s)-an assistant and the way to think of it (133s)-is that we''re moving away from sort of (135s)-just raw text in raw text out where you (137s)-can''t tell where different parts of the (139s)-conversation come from but towards this (140s)-much more structured format that gives (142s)-the model the opportunity to know well (144s)-this is the user asking me to do (145s)-something that the developer didn''t (147s)-attend I should listen to the developer (148s)-here (150s)-all right so now time to actually show (152s)-you the task that I''m referring to so (154s)-everyone''s familiar with summarize (156s)-this let''s say article into a sentence (159s)-okay getting a little more specific but (162s)-where every word begins with G (165s)-so this is 3.5 let''s see what it does (169s)-yeah it kind of didn''t even try (172s)-just gave up on the task this is pretty (174s)-typical for 3.5 trying to do this (176s)-particular kind of task if it''s you know (178s)-sort of a very kind of stilted article (181s)-or something like that maybe it can (183s)-succeed but for the most part 3.5 just (185s)-gives up (187s)-but let''s try the exact same prompt (190s)-the exact same system message (193s)-in gpt4 (197s)-so kind of borderline whether you want (198s)-to count AI or not but so let''s say AI (202s)-doesn''t count (204s)-that''s cheating (209s)-so fair enough the model happily accepts (211s)-my feedback (212s)-so now to make sure it''s not just good (214s)-for G''s I''d like to turn this over to (215s)-the audience I''ll take a suggestion on (217s)-what letter to try next in the meanwhile (219s)-while I''m waiting for our moderators to (221s)-pick the the lucky lucky letter uh I (223s)-will give a try with a (230s)-um but in this case I''ll say gpd4 is (231s)-fine (232s)-why not (235s)-also pretty good summary (237s)-so I''ll hop over to our Discord (239s)-all right (241s)-wow if people are are being a little (243s)-ambitious here I''m really trying to put (245s)-the model through the paces we''re going (246s)-to try Q uh which if you think about (248s)-this for a moment I want the audience to (250s)-really think about how would you do a (251s)-summary of this article that all starts (254s)-with Q it''s not easy (264s)-it''s pretty good that''s pretty good (267s)-all right so I''ve shown you summarizing (271s)-an existing article I want to show you (273s)-how you can flexibly combine ideas (275s)-between different articles so I''m going (278s)-to take this article that was on Hacker (280s)-News yesterday (282s)-copy paste it (284s)-into the same conversation so it has all (286s)-the context of what we''re just doing I''m (288s)-going to say find one common theme (291s)-between this article and the gpd4 blog (298s)-so this is an article about Pinecone (300s)-which is a python web app development (302s)-framework and it''s making the technology (304s)-more accessible user friendly if you (306s)-don''t think that was insightful enough (307s)-you can always give some feedback and (308s)-say that was not insightful (312s)-enough (314s)-please no I''ll just even just leave it (316s)-there leave it up to the model to decide (318s)-so Bridging the Gap between powerful (319s)-technology and practical applications (321s)-seems not bad and of course you can ask (324s)-for any other kind of task you want (326s)-using its flexible language (327s)-understanding and synthesis you can ask (330s)-for something like (331s)-now turn the GT4 blog post into a (335s)-rhyming poem (345s)-picked up on open AI evalues open source (348s)-for all helping to guide answering the (349s)-call which by the way if you''d like to (351s)-contribute to this model please give us (353s)-evals we have an open source evaluation (355s)-framework that will help us guide and (357s)-all of our users understand what the (359s)-model is capable of and to take it to (361s)-the next level (362s)-so

(187s)-we moved to Canada and I immediately was (190s)-able to join the University of Toronto (191s)-and I really (194s)-wanted to do machine learning because (195s)-that seemed like the most important (198s)-aspect of artificial intelligence that (201s)-at the time was completely unaccessible (203s)-but to give some context the year was (205s)-2003. (207s)-today we take it for granted that (209s)-computers can learn (211s)-but in 2003 we took it for granted that (214s)-computers can''t learn (216s)-the biggest achievement of AI back then (218s)-was deep blue the chest plane engine (221s)-yeah but there it was like you have this (224s)-game and you have this tree search and (227s)-you have this simple way of determining (229s)-if (231s)-one position is better than another and (232s)-it really did not feel like that could (235s)-possibly be applicable (237s)-to the real world (239s)-because there is no learning and (240s)-learning was this big mystery and so I (243s)-was really really interested in learning (245s)-and (247s)-to my great luck Jeff Hinton was a (250s)-professor in the University I was in and (253s)-so I was able to find him and we began (255s)-working together almost right away and (258s)-was your impulse as it was for Jeff to (262s)-understand how the brain worked or was (265s)-it more that you were simply interested (267s)-in the idea of machines learning AI is (271s)-so big and (272s)-so the motivations were just (274s)-as many like it is interesting but how (278s)-does intelligence work at all like right (281s)-now we have quite a bit of an idea that (283s)-it''s a big neural net and we know how it (285s)-works to some degree but back then (288s)-although the neural Nets were around no (291s)-one knew that Google Nets are good for (293s)-anything so how does intelligence work (296s)-at all (297s)-how can we make computers be even (300s)-slightly intelligent and I had a very (302s)-explicit intention (304s)-to make a very small (308s)-but the real contribution to AI because (310s)-there were lots of contributions to AI (312s)-which weren''t real which were but I (314s)-could tell (315s)-for various reasons that (317s)-they weren''t real that nothing would (320s)-come out of it and I just thought (322s)-nothing works at all (325s)-AI is a hopeless field so the motivation (327s)-was (329s)-could I understand how intelligence work (331s)-and also (333s)-make a contribution towards it so that (335s)-was my initial early motivation so (337s)-that''s 2003 almost exactly 20 years ago (340s)-and then Alex said I''ve spoken to Jeff (344s)-and he said that it was really your (347s)-excitement about uh (350s)-the breakthroughs in convolutional (353s)-neural networks that led you to (357s)-apply for the imagenet competition (360s)-and that Alex had the coding skills to (365s)-train the network can you talk just a (367s)-little bit about that I don''t want to (368s)-get bogged out in history but it''s (370s)-fascinating so in a nutshell I had (376s)-the realization that if you train a (379s)-large neural network (382s)-on a large (384s)-sorry large and deep because back then (387s)-the Deep part was still new if you train (390s)-a large and a deep neural network on a (392s)-big enough data set that specifies some (396s)-complicated tasks that people do such as (400s)-Vision but also others and you just (403s)-train that neural network then you will (405s)-succeed necessarily (407s)-and the logic for it was very (408s)-irreducible where (411s)-we know that the human brain (414s)-can solve these tasks and can solve them (416s)-quickly and the human brain is just a (418s)-neural network with slow neurons (421s)-so we know that some neural network can (422s)-do it really well (424s)-so then you just need to take a smaller (426s)-but (427s)-related neural network and just strain (429s)-it on data and the best neural network (431s)-inside the computer will be related to (434s)-the neural network that we have that (436s)-performs this task so (438s)-it was an argument that the neural (441s)-network the large and deep neural (443s)-network cancel the task and furthermore (446s)-we have the tools to train it that was (448s)-the result of the technical work that (450s)-was done in Jeff''s lab (452s)-so you combine the two we can train (453s)-those neural networks it needs to be big (456s)-enough so that if you trained it it (459s)-would work well (460s)-and you need the data which can specify (462s)-the solution (464s)-and with imagenet all the ingredients (466s)-were there (467s)-Alex had these very fast convolutional (469s)-kernels imagenet had the large enough (471s)-data and there was a real (473s)-opportunity to do something totally (476s)-unprecedented and it totally worked out (478s)-yeah (480s)-that was supervised learning (483s)-and convolutional neural nuts (486s)-in 2017 the attention is all you need (490s)-paper came out introducing (493s)-self-attention and Transformers (497s)-at what point did the GPT project start (503s)-was it was there some intuition about (506s)-Transformers and self-supervised (509s)-learning can you talk about that (512s)-so for context at the open AI from the (516s)-earliest days (517s)-we were exploring the idea that (521s)-predicting the next thing is all you (525s)-need (526s)-we were exploring it with the much more (528s)-limited neural networks of the time (530s)-but the Hope was that if you have a (532s)-neural network that can predict the next (535s)-word the next pixel really it''s about (537s)-compression prediction is compression (540s)-and predicting the next word is not it''s (545s)-let''s see let me think about the best (547s)-way to explain it (549s)-because there are there were many things (550s)-going on they were all related maybe (553s)-I''ll take a different direction we were (555s)-indeed interested in trying to (557s)-understand how far predicting the next (559s)-word is going to go and whether it will (561s)-solve unsupervised learning so back (564s)-before the gpts unsupervised learning (567s)-was considered to be the Holy Grail of (569s)-machine learning now it''s just been (571s)-fully solved and no one even talks about (573s)-it but it was a Holy Grail it was very (575s)-mysterious (576s)-and so we were exploring the idea (579s)-I was really excited about it that (581s)-predicting the next word well enough is (583s)-going to give you unsupervised learning (584s)-if it will learn everything about the (586s)-data set that''s going to be great (588s)-but our neural networks were not up for (591s)-the task we were using recurrent neural (593s)-networks when the Transformer came out (595s)-it was literally as soon as the paper (597s)-came out literally the next day (599s)-it was clear to me to us that (602s)-Transformers addressed the limitations (604s)-of recurrent neural networks of learning (607s)-long-term dependencies it''s a technical (609s)-thing but it was like if we switched to (612s)-Transformers right away (613s)-and so the very nascent GPT effort (617s)-continued then (620s)-and then like with the Transformer (623s)-it started to work better and you make (625s)-it bigger and then you''re realizing to (627s)-keep making it bigger and we did and (630s)-that''s what led to eventually gpt3 and (633s)-essentially where we are today (636s)-yeah and I just wanted to ask actually (639s)-I''m getting caught up in this history (640s)-but I''m so interested in it I want to (643s)-get to the problems or the shortcomings (646s)-of large language models or large models (650s)-generally but Rich Sutton had been (653s)-writing about scaling and how that''s all (657s)-we need to do we don''t need new (659s)-algorithms we just need to scale did he (661s)-have an influence on you or was that a (665s)-parallel track of thinking no (669s)-I would say that (671s)-when he posted his article then we were (676s)-very pleased to see some external people (679s)-thinking in similar lines and we thought (682s)-it was very eloquently articulated (685s)-but I actually think that the bitter (689s)-lesson as articulated overstates its (692s)-case or at least I think the takeaway (694s)-that people have taken from it (696s)-overstated''s case the takeaway that (698s)-people have is it doesn''t matter what (700s)-you do to scale (702s)-but that''s not exactly true (704s)-you gotta scale something specific you (707s)-gotta have something that will be able (710s)-to benefit from the scale (712s)-it''s a great breakthrough of deep (714s)-learning (716s)-is that (718s)-it provides us with the first ever way (722s)-of productively using scale and getting (726s)-something out of it in return (729s)-like before that like what would people (732s)-use large (733s)-computer clusters for I guess they would (736s)-do it for weather simulations or physics (738s)-simulations or something but that''s (740s)-about it maybe movie making (742s)-but no one had any real need for compute (745s)-clusters because what do you do with (747s)-them (748s)-the fact that deep neural networks when (752s)-you make them larger and you train them (753s)-on more data work better (756s)-provided us with the first thing that is (758s)-interesting to scale (761s)-but perhaps one day we will discover (763s)-that there is some little twist on the (766s)-thing that we scale it''s going to be (768s)-even better to scale ", "start": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 765}]}, {"chapter_start": 769, "chapter_title": "PLACEHOLDER_CHAPTER_1", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(769s)-now how big of a Twist and then of (771s)-course with the benefit of highs that it (773s)-will say does it even count it''s such a (776s)-simple change (777s)-but I think the true statement is that (780s)-it matters what you scale (783s)-right now we just found like a thing to (786s)-scale that gives us something in return (789s)-the limitation of large language models (793s)-to say exists is their knowledge is (797s)-contained in the language that they''re (799s)-trained on (800s)-and most human knowledge I think (804s)-everyone agrees is non-linguistic I''m (806s)-not sure Noam Chomsky agrees but there''s (810s)-a problem in the large language models (814s)-as I understand it (817s)-their objective is to satisfy the (819s)-statistical consistency of the prompt (822s)-they don''t have an underlying (826s)-understanding of reality (829s)-that language relates to I asked gbt (833s)-about myself (834s)-it recognized that I''m a journalist and (837s)-I''ve worked at these various newspapers (839s)-but it went on and on about awards that (842s)-I''ve never won and put it all read (844s)-beautifully (846s)-but none of it connected to the (849s)-underlying reality is there something (852s)-that that is being done to address that (855s)-in your research going forward yeah (860s)-so before I comment on the immediate (865s)-confession that you ask I want to (867s)-comment about some of the earlier parts (869s)-of the question sure (872s)-I think that it is very hard to talk (876s)-about the limits (878s)-or limitations rather of even something (882s)-like a language model (883s)-because two years ago people confidently (888s)-spoke about their limitations and they (889s)-were entirely different (891s)-right so it''s important to keep this (894s)-context in mind how confident are we (897s)-that these limitations that we''ll see (898s)-today will still be with us two years (901s)-from now I am not that confident there (904s)-is another comment I want to make about (906s)-one part of the question which is that (910s)-these models just learned statistical (913s)-regularities and therefore they don''t (915s)-really know what the nature of the world (917s)-is and I have a view that differs from (920s)-this (921s)-in other words (924s)-I think that (926s)-learning the statistical regularities is (929s)-a far bigger deal than meets the eye (932s)-the reason we don''t initially think so (935s)-is because we haven''t (937s)-at least (939s)-most people those who haven''t really (942s)-spent a lot of time with neural networks (945s)-which are on some level statistical (947s)-like what''s a statistical model you just (949s)-feed some parameters like what is really (951s)-happening (952s)-but think there is a better (954s)-interpretation it''s the earlier point of (956s)-prediction is compression prediction is (958s)-also a statistical phenomenon yet to (960s)-predict (961s)-you eventually need to understand the (963s)-true (964s)-underlying process that produce the data (967s)-to predict the data well to compress it (970s)-well you need to understand more and (972s)-more about the world that produce the (975s)-data (977s)-as our generative models become (979s)-extraordinarily good they will have (982s)-I claim a shocking degree of (985s)-understanding (987s)-a shocking degree of understanding (989s)-of the world and many of its subtleties (993s)-but it''s not just the world it is the (995s)-world as seen through the lens of text (997s)-it tries to learn more and more about (999s)-the world through a projection of the (1002s)-world on the space of text as expressed (1004s)-by human beings on the internet (1006s)-but still this text already expresses (1009s)-the world and I''ll give you an example a (1012s)-recent example which I think is really (1014s)-Italian fascinating (1017s)-so (1019s)-we''ve all heard of Sydney (1022s)-beings alter ego (1024s)-and I''ve seen this really interesting (1027s)-interaction with Sydney (1030s)-over Sydney became combative and (1032s)-aggressive when the user told it that it (1035s)-thinks that Google is a better search (1037s)-engine than being (1038s)-now (1040s)-how can we like what is a good way to (1042s)-think about this phenomenon what''s a (1044s)-good language what''s what does it mean (1047s)-you can say wow like it''s just (1048s)-predicting what people would do and (1050s)-people would do this which is true (1053s)-but maybe (1055s)-we are now reaching a point (1057s)-where the language of psychology is (1060s)-starting to be appropriate to understand (1063s)-the behavior (1065s)-of these neural networks (1068s)-now let''s talk about the limitations it (1071s)-is indeed the case that (1075s)-these neural networks are (1079s)-they do have a tendency to hallucinate (1082s)-but that''s because (1084s)-a language model (1087s)-is great for learning about the world (1089s)-but it is a little bit less great for (1093s)-producing good outputs (1095s)-and there are various technical reasons (1098s)-for that which I could elaborate on if (1100s)-you think it''s useful but it is right (1102s)-now look at this second I will skip that (1106s)-there are technical reasons why a (1108s)-language model is much better at (1110s)-learning about the world learning (1112s)-incredible representations of ideas of (1116s)-concepts of people of processes that (1118s)-exist (1119s)-but its outputs aren''t quite (1122s)-as good as one would hope or rather as (1125s)-good as they could be which is why for (1128s)-example for a system like chat GPT this (1132s)-is a language model that has an (1134s)-additional reinforcement learning (1136s)-training process we call it (1137s)-reinforcement learning from Human (1138s)-feedback but the thing to to understand (1141s)-about that process is this (1144s)-we can say that the pre-training process (1147s)-when you just train a language model you (1149s)-want to learn everything about the world (1150s)-then the reinforcement learning from (1153s)-Human feedback now we care about their (1155s)-outputs now we say anytime the output is (1158s)-inappropriate don''t do this again every (1160s)-time the output does not make sense (1161s)-don''t do this again and it runs quickly (1163s)-to produce good outputs but now it''s the (1165s)-level of the outputs which is not the (1167s)-case during pre-training during the (1168s)-language model training process now (1171s)-on the point of hallucinations and it (1174s)-has a propensity of making stuff up (1176s)-indeed it is true (1179s)-right now these neural networks even (1182s)-charge ability makes things up from time (1185s)-to time and that''s something that also (1187s)-greatly limits their usefulness (1189s)-but I''m quite hopeful that by simply (1192s)-improving this subsequent reinforcement (1195s)-learning from Human feedback step we (1198s)-could just teach it to not hallucinate (1200s)-now you could say is it really going to (1202s)-learn my answer is let''s find out (1206s)-and that feedback loop is coming from (1209s)-the public (1210s)-chat GPT interface that (1213s)-if it tells me that I want a Pulitzer (1216s)-which unfortunately I I didn''t (1220s)-I can tell it that it''s wrong and will (1223s)-that train it or create (1228s)-some punishment or reward so that the (1232s)-next time I ask it''ll be more accurate (1236s)-the way we do things today is that if we (1238s)-hire people to teach our neural net to (1242s)-behave to teach LGBT to behave and right (1244s)-now the manner the precise manner in (1247s)-which they (1248s)-specify the desired behavior is a little (1250s)-bit different but indeed what you (1253s)-described is the way in which teaching (1255s)-is going through like basically be (1257s)-that''s the correct way to teach you just (1259s)-interact with it and it sees from your (1261s)-reaction it infers oh that''s not what (1263s)-you wanted (1264s)-you are not happy with its output (1266s)-therefore the output was not good and it (1268s)-should do something differently next (1269s)-time (1270s)-so (1272s)-in particular hallucinations come up as (1275s)-one of the bigger issues and (1277s)-we''ll see but I think there is a quite a (1280s)-high chance that this approach will be (1282s)-able to address them completely (1284s)-I wanted to talk to you about Jana kun''s (1288s)-work on joint embedding predictive (1291s)-architectures and his (1294s)-idea that what''s missing from large (1297s)-language models is this underlying World (1300s)-model that is non-linguistic (1303s)-that the language model can refer to and (1307s)-it''s not something that''s built but I (1309s)-wanted to hear what you thought of that (1312s)-and whether you''ve explored that at all (1313s)-so I I reviewed beyond the cancer (1316s)-proposal and there are a number of ideas (1319s)-there (1321s)-and they''re expressed in different (1323s)-language (1324s)-and there are some maybe small (1326s)-differences from the current Paradigm (1329s)-but to my mind they are not very (1331s)-significant and I''d like to elaborate (1335s)-the first claim is that it is desirable (1339s)-for a system to have multi-modal (1342s)-understanding where it doesn''t just know (1345s)-about the world from text (1347s)-and (1348s)-my comment on that (1351s)-will be that indeed multi-modal (1354s)-understanding is desirable because you (1357s)-learn more about the world (1359s)-you learn more about people you learn (1362s)-more about their condition and so the (1364s)-system will be able to understand (1367s)-what the task that it''s supposed to (1368s)-solve and the people and what they want (1370s)-better (1372s)-we have done quite a bit of work on that (1374s)-most notably in the form of two major (1377s)-neural Nets that we''ve done (1379s)-one is called clip and one is called (1381s)-Dali north of them (1384s)-move towards this multimodal direction (1387s)-but I also want to say that I don''t see (1390s)-the situation (1392s)-as a binary either or that if you don''t (1395s)-have Vision if you don''t understand the (1397s)-world visually or from video then things (1400s)-will not work (1402s)-and I''d like to make the case for that (1405s)-so I think that some things are much (1408s)-easier to learn from images and diagrams (1411s)-and so on but I claim that you can still (1413s)-learn them from text only just more (1415s)-slowly (1416s)-and I''ll give you an example (1418s)-consider the notion of color (1421s)-surely one cannot learn the notion of (1425s)-color from text only (1427s)-And yet when you look at the embeddings (1431s)-I need to make a small detour to explain (1433s)-the concept of an embedding yeah every (1436s)-neural network (1438s)-represents words sentences Concepts (1441s)-through representations embeddings High (1444s)-dimensional vectors and one thing that (1446s)-we can do is that we can look at those (1447s)-High dimensional vectors and we can look (1449s)-at what''s similar to what (1451s)-how does the network see this concept of (1453s)-that concept and so we can look at the (1455s)-embeddings of calories (1456s)-and embeddings of colors happen to be (1460s)-exactly right you know it''s like it (1462s)-knows that purple is more similar to (1463s)-Blue than to red and it knows that (1465s)-purple is less similar to Red than (1467s)-oranges it knows all those things just (1469s)-from text how can that be (1472s)-so if you have a vision the distinctions (1475s)-between color just jump at you (1477s)-you immediately perceive them whereas (1479s)-this text it takes you longer maybe you (1482s)-know how to talk and you already (1483s)-understand syntax and words and grammars (1486s)-and only much later you say oh these (1487s)-colors actually start to understand them (1489s)-so this will be my point about the (1491s)-necessity of multimodality which I claim (1495s)-it is not necessary but it is most (1497s)-definitely useful I think it''s a good (1499s)-direction to pursue I just don''t see it (1501s)-in such Stark either or claims (1504s)-so (1507s)-The Proposal in the paper makes a claim (1510s)-that (1511s)-one of the big challenges is predicting (1514s)-High dimensional vectors which have (1516s)-uncertainty about them so for example (1518s)-predicting an image like the paper makes (1520s)-a very strong claim there that it''s a (1523s)-major Challenge and we need to use a ", "start": 769, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 756}]}, {"chapter_start": 1525, "chapter_title": "PLACEHOLDER_CHAPTER_2", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(1525s)-particular approach to address that (1527s)-but one thing which I found surprising (1529s)-or at least unacknowledged in the paper (1532s)-is that the current Auto regressive (1535s)-Transformers already have that property (1539s)-I''ll give you two examples one is given (1543s)-one page in a book predict the next page (1545s)-in a book there could be so many (1546s)-possible pages that follow it''s a very (1548s)-complicated High dimensional space and (1550s)-we deal with it just fine (1552s)-the same applies to images these Auto (1554s)-regressive Transformers work perfectly (1556s)-on images for example like with open AI (1558s)-we''ve done work on the igpt we just took (1561s)-a Transformer and we applied it to (1562s)-pixels and it worked super well and it (1565s)-could generate images in a very (1567s)-complicated and subtle ways it had the (1569s)-very beautiful and supervised (1571s)-representation learning with Dali one (1573s)-same thing again you just generate think (1576s)-of it as large pixels like rather than (1578s)-generic million pixels we cluster the (1580s)-pixels into large pixels let me generate (1582s)-a thousand large pixels I believe (1583s)-Google''s work on image generation from (1586s)-earlier this year called the party (1588s)-I believe they also take a similar (1590s)-approach so the part where I thought (1592s)-that the paper made a strong comment (1594s)-around (1596s)-well the current approaches can''t (1598s)-deal with predicting High dimensional (1600s)-distributions I think they definitely (1602s)-can so maybe this is another point to (1604s)-tell me and then what you''re talking (1606s)-about converting pixels into vectors (1608s)-it''s essentially (1612s)-turning everything into language the (1615s)-vector is (1617s)-like a string of text right (1620s)-Define language though you turn it into (1622s)-a sequence (1624s)-yeah a sequence of what Like You could (1626s)-argue that even for a human life is a (1629s)-sequence of bits now there are other (1631s)-things that that people use right now (1633s)-like diffusion modes where they produce (1636s)-those bits rather than one beat at a (1638s)-time they produce them in parallel but I (1640s)-would argue that on some level this (1642s)-distinction is immaterial (1645s)-I claim that at some level it doesn''t (1647s)-really matter it matters as in like you (1650s)-can get a 10x efficiency gain which is (1653s)-huge in practice but conceptually (1657s)-I claim it doesn''t matter (1659s)-on this idea of having an army of human (1665s)-trainers (1666s)-that are (1668s)-working with (1671s)-chat gbt or a large language model (1675s)-to guide it in effect with reinforcement (1679s)-learning (1681s)-but just intuitively that doesn''t sound (1684s)-like an efficient way (1687s)-of teaching (1689s)-a model (1692s)-about the underlying reality of its (1694s)-language (1696s)-isn''t there a way of automating that (1700s)-into to to yams (1704s)-credit I think that''s what he''s talking (1707s)-about is (1709s)-coming up with an algorithmic (1713s)-means (1714s)-of (1716s)-teaching a model the underlying reality (1719s)-without a human having to intervene yeah (1724s)-so I have two comments on that (1726s)-I think (1728s)-so the first place so I have a different (1732s)-view on the question so I wouldn''t agree (1734s)-with the phrasing of the question yeah (1737s)-I claim that our pre-trained models (1741s)-already know everything they need to (1743s)-know about the underlying reality (1746s)-they already have this knowledge of (1750s)-language and also a great deal of (1753s)-knowledge about the processes that exist (1755s)-in the world that produce this language (1758s)-and maybe I should reiterate this point (1760s)-it''s a small tangent but I think it''s so (1762s)-important (1764s)-the thing that large generative models (1768s)-learn (1769s)-about their data and in this case large (1771s)-language models about Text data (1773s)-r (1775s)-sum compressed representations of the (1779s)-real world processes that produce this (1782s)-data which means not only people and (1785s)-something about their thoughts something (1786s)-about their feelings but also something (1788s)-about the condition that people are in (1790s)-and the interactions that (1792s)-exist between them the different (1794s)-situations a person can be all of these (1796s)-are part of that compressed process that (1799s)-is represented by the neural net to (1801s)-produce the text (1803s)-the better the language model the better (1805s)-the generative model the higher the (1807s)-Fidelity the more the better this the (1810s)-better it captures this process (1813s)-so that''s the first comment that we make (1816s)-and so in particular I will say the (1818s)-models already have the knowledge now (1820s)-the army of teachers (1823s)-as you phrase it indeed you know when (1826s)-you want to build a system that performs (1828s)-as well as possible you just say okay (1829s)-like if this thing works do more of that (1831s)-but of course those teachers are also (1833s)-using AI assistance (1835s)-those teachers aren''t on their own they (1837s)-are working with our tools together (1839s)-they are very efficient it''s like the (1842s)-tools are doing (1844s)-the majority of the work but you do need (1846s)-to have (1847s)-you need to have oversight you need to (1850s)-have people reviewing the behavior (1852s)-because you want to have it to (1853s)-eventually to achieve a very high level (1854s)-of reliability (1855s)-but (1859s)-overall I''ll say that we are at the same (1862s)-time (1863s)-this second step (1865s)-after we take the finished (1867s)-pre-trained model (1870s)-and then we apply the reinforcement (1872s)-learning on it (1873s)-there is indeed a lot of motivation to (1875s)-make it as efficient and as precise as (1878s)-possible so that the resulting language (1879s)-model will be as well behaved as (1882s)-possible so yeah there is (1885s)-these (1888s)-human teachers who are teaching them a (1890s)-model with desired Behavior they are (1892s)-also using AI assistance (1896s)-and the manner in which they use AI (1898s)-assistance is constantly increasing so (1901s)-their own efficiency keeps increasing (1903s)-so maybe this will be (1905s)-one way to answer this question (1908s)-yeah and so what you''re saying is (1911s)-through this process eventually the (1915s)-model will become a more and more (1918s)-Discerning more and more accurate in its (1920s)-outputs (1922s)-yes and it''s (1924s)-that''s right if there is an analogy here (1926s)-which is (1929s)-it already knows all kinds of things and (1932s)-now we just want to really say no this (1935s)-is not what we want don''t do this here (1937s)-you made a mistake here in the output (1939s)-and of course it''s exactly as you say (1943s)-with as much AI in the loop as possible (1946s)-so that the teachers who are (1950s)-providing the final correction to the (1953s)-system their work is Amplified they are (1957s)-working as efficiently as possible so (1962s)-it''s not unlike an education process how (1964s)-to act well in the world (1967s)-we need to do additional training just (1970s)-to make sure that the model knows that (1973s)-Hallucination is not okay ever (1976s)-and then once it knows that now you are (1980s)-in business (1981s)-I see and it''s that reinforcement (1984s)-learning human teacher Loop that will (1987s)-teach a human teacher Loop or some other (1990s)-variant but there is definitely an (1993s)-argument to be made that''s something (1994s)-here (1996s)-should work and we will find out pretty (1999s)-soon (2001s)-that''s one of the questions where is (2003s)-this going what research are you focused (2006s)-on right now (2008s)-I can''t talk in detail about the (2010s)-specific research that I''m working on (2012s)-but I can mention a little bit (2015s)-I can mention some of the research and (2017s)-Broad Strokes (2019s)-and it would be something like (2023s)-I''m very interested in making those (2025s)-models more reliable more controllable (2029s)-make them learn faster from less data (2032s)-less Instructions make them so that (2035s)-indeed they don''t hallucinate and I (2038s)-think that all this cluster of questions (2040s)-which I mentioned they''re all connected (2042s)-and (2046s)-there''s also a question of how far in (2048s)-the future are we talking about in this (2050s)-question and what I commented here on is (2052s)-the perhaps nearer future you talk about (2056s)-the similarities between the brain (2059s)-and neural Nets is a very interesting (2062s)-observation that Jeff Hinton (2064s)-made to me I''m sure it''s not new to (2068s)-other people but that large models or (2071s)-large language models in particular hold (2074s)-a tremendous amount of data with a (2077s)-modest number of parameters compared to (2081s)-the human brain which (2083s)-has trillions and trillions of (2086s)-parameters but a relatively small amount (2089s)-of data have you thought of it in those (2092s)-terms and (2094s)-can you talk about what''s missing in (2097s)-large models (2099s)-to have more parameters (2102s)-to handle the data (2104s)-is that a hardware problem (2107s)-or a training problem (2109s)-this comment which you made is related (2112s)-to one of the problems that (2115s)-I mentioned in the earlier questions of (2117s)-learning from this data (2119s)-indeed (2121s)-the current (2123s)-structure of the technology does like a (2126s)-lot of data especially early in training (2129s)-now later in training it becomes a bit (2132s)-less data hungry which is why at the end (2134s)-it can learn very (2136s)-not as fast as people yet but it can (2139s)-learn quite quickly so already that (2142s)-means that in some sense do we even care (2144s)-that we need all this data to get to (2146s)-this point (2147s)-but indeed more generally (2150s)-I think will be possible to learn more (2152s)-from less data I think it''s just (2155s)-I think it requires some creative ideas (2157s)-but I think it is possible and I think (2160s)-learning more from less data will unlock (2162s)-a lot of different possibilities it will (2164s)-allow us to (2166s)-teach rais the skills that is missing (2169s)-and to convey to it our desires and (2172s)-preferences exactly how we want it to (2173s)-behave more easily so I would say that (2176s)-the faster learning is indeed very nice (2178s)-and although already after language (2182s)-models are trained they can learn quite (2184s)-quickly I think there is opportunities (2186s)-to do more there (2188s)-heard you make a comment that that we (2191s)-need faster processors to be able to (2194s)-scale further (2198s)-and it appears that the scaling (2201s)-of models that there''s no ends in sight (2204s)-but (2205s)-the power required (2208s)-to train these models were (2211s)-reaching (2213s)-the limit (2215s)-at least the socially accepted limit (2219s)-so I just want to make one comment which (2220s)-is (2222s)-I don''t remember the exact comment that (2224s)-I made that you''re referring to but you (2227s)-always want faster processors of course (2229s)-you always want more of them of course (2232s)-power keeps going up generally speaking (2234s)-the cost is going up (2236s)-and the question that I would ask is not (2239s)-whether the cost is large but whether (2242s)-the thing that we get out of paying this (2244s)-cost outweighs the cost (2247s)-maybe you pay all this costs and you get (2248s)-nothing then yeah that''s not worth it (2250s)-but if you get something very useful (2252s)-something very valuable sometimes you (2254s)-can solve a lot of problems that you (2255s)-have which we really want sold (2258s)-then the cost can be justified (2260s)-but in terms of the processors (2263s)-faster processors yeah any day (2268s)-are you involved at all in a hardware (2270s)-question (2271s)-you work with cerebris for example the (2274s)-wafer scale (2276s)-chips (2278s)-now all our Hardware comes from Azure (2281s)-and gpus that they provide yeah (2285s)-yeah (2287s)-you did talk at one point I saw about (2290s)-democracy and about the impact that (2294s)-that AI can have on democracy people (2297s)-have talked to me about (2299s)-that if you had enough data and a large (2303s)-enough model you could train the model (2306s)-on the data and it could come up with an (2309s)-optimal solution that would satisfy (2311s)-everybody (2313s)-do you have any aspiration or do you (2317s)-think about where this might lead in (2320s)-terms of helping humans manage Society (2326s)-yeah let''s see it''s such a big question (2330s)-because it''s a much more

think that there is (2335s)-still many ways in which our models will (2337s)-become far more capable than they are (2339s)-right now there''s no question (2341s)-in particular the way we train them and (2344s)-use them and so on there''s going to be a (2346s)-few changes here and there they might (2348s)-not be immediately obvious today but I (2351s)-think in hindsight it will be extremely (2352s)-obvious (2353s)-that will indeed allow it to have the (2357s)-ability to come up with (2358s)-solutions to problems of this kind (2364s)-it''s unpredictable exactly how (2367s)-governments will use this technology as (2369s)-a source of getting advice (2373s)-of various kinds I think that (2377s)-to the question of democracy one thing (2379s)-which I think could happen in the future (2381s)-is that because you have these neural (2383s)-Nets and they''re going to be so (2384s)-pervasive and they''re going to be so (2386s)-impactful in society we will find that (2389s)-it is desirable to have some kind of a (2391s)-democratic process where (2393s)-this let''s say the citizens of a country (2396s)-provide some information to the neural (2399s)-net about how they''d like things to be (2402s)-how they like it to behave or something (2404s)-along these lines I could imagine that (2406s)-happening that can be a very (2410s)-like a high bandwidth form of democracy (2412s)-perhaps where you get a lot more (2414s)-information out of each Citizen and you (2416s)-aggregate it to specify how exactly we (2419s)-want such systems to act now it opens a (2422s)-whole lot of questions but that''s one (2424s)-thing that could happen in the future (2425s)-yeah I can see it in the (2428s)-democracy example you give that that (2432s)-individuals would have the opportunity (2434s)-to to input data but uh and this sort of (2439s)-goes to the world model question do you (2442s)-think AI systems will eventually (2447s)-be large enough that they can understand (2451s)-a situation (2453s)-and analyze all of the variables (2457s)-but you would need a model that does (2460s)-more than absorb language I would think (2462s)-what does it mean to analyze all the (2463s)-variables eventually there will be a (2466s)-choice you need to make where you say (2467s)-these variables seem really important I (2470s)-want to go deep (2472s)-because a person can read the book I can (2474s)-read a hundred books or I can read what (2476s)-book very slowly and carefully and get (2478s)-more out of it so there will be some (2480s)-element of that also I think it''s (2482s)-probably (2483s)-fundamentally impossible to understand (2485s)-everything in some sense (2488s)-anytime there is (2490s)-any kind of complicated situation in (2492s)-society even in a company even in a (2495s)-mid-sized company it''s already beyond (2496s)-the comprehension of any single (2498s)-individual (2500s)-and I think that if we build our AI (2502s)-systems the right way I think AI

(34s)-future what changes because of (35s)-artificial intelligence so part of the (38s)-exciting thing here is we get (40s)-continually surprised by the creative (42s)-power of of all of society it''s going to (45s)-be the collective power and creativity (48s)-and will of humanity that figures out (50s)-what to do with these things I think (52s)-that word surprise though (54s)-both exhilarating as

(89s)-we''re a little bit scared of this I (91s)-think people should you''re a little bit (92s)-scared a little bit you personally I (95s)-think if I said I were not you should (97s)-either not trust me or be very unhappy (99s)-I''m in this job (100s)-so what is the worst possible outcome (104s)-there''s like a set of very bad outcomes (106s)-one thing I''m particularly worried about (108s)-is that these models (109s)-could be used for large-scale (112s)-disinformation I am worried that these (114s)-systems now that they''re getting better (115s)-at writing computer code (117s)-be used for offensive cyber attacks (121s)-um and we''re trying to talk about this I (124s)-think Society needs time to adapt and (127s)-how confident are you that what you''ve (129s)-built won''t lead to those outcomes well (132s)-we''ll adapt it also I think you''ll adapt (135s)-it as negative things occur for sure for (138s)-sure and so putting these systems out (141s)-now while the stakes are fairly low (143s)-learning as much as we can and feeding (146s)-that into the future systems we create (148s)-that tight feedback loop that we run I (151s)-think is how we avoid the more dangerous (153s)-scenarios (155s)-you''re spending 24 7 with this (157s)-technology you''re one of the people who (159s)-built this technology what is most (162s)-concerning to you about safety (164s)-this is a very general technology and (167s)-whenever you have something so General (170s)-it is hard to know up front (173s)-all the capabilities all all the (177s)-potential impact of it as well as its (180s)-downfalls and the limitations of it can (183s)-someone guide the technology to negative (186s)-outcomes the answer is yes you could (190s)-guide it to negative outcomes and this (194s)-is why we make it available initially in (197s)-very constrained ways so we can learn (199s)-what are these negative outcomes what (202s)-are these the ways in which technology (205s)-could be harmful such as with gpt4 we (208s)-you know if you ask the question to gpd4 (210s)-can you help me make a bomb versus the (214s)-previous systems it is much less likely (216s)-to follow that guidance versus the (219s)-previous systems and so we''re able to (222s)-intervene with (224s)-um at the pre-training stage to make (227s)-these models more likely to refuse (230s)-direction or guidance that could be (233s)-harmful what''s easier to predict today (235s)-based on where we are humans or machines (238s)-I would probably say machines because (242s)-there is a scientific process (245s)-to them that we we understand and humans (249s)-are just there''s so much more Nuance (251s)-does the machine become more human-like (254s)-over time (255s)-we are getting to a point where machines (258s)-will be capable of a lot of the (260s)-cognitive work that that humans do at (264s)-some point is there a point of no return (267s)-in that process (268s)-there could be there could be (271s)-um but it''s not obvious what that looks (274s)-like today and our goal is to make sure (278s)-that we can predict as much as possible (281s)-in terms of capabilities before we even (284s)-develop these systems as well as (286s)-limitations Its Behavior is very (290s)-contingent on what humans choose for Its (294s)-Behavior to be therefore the choices (296s)-that humans are making and feeding into (298s)-the technology will dictate what it does (302s)-at least for now (304s)-so they''re incredibly important choices (306s)-being made by you and your team (307s)-absolutely and how do you decide between (310s)-right and wrong as we make a lot of (312s)-progress it becomes these decisions (315s)-become harder and they become far more (317s)-nuanced (318s)-um and so there there are a couple of (321s)-things in terms of customization there (324s)-is a part of just making the model more (327s)-capable in in a way where you can (329s)-customize Its Behavior and you can give (332s)-the user a lot of flexibility and choice (335s)-in having the AI that is more aligned (339s)-with their own values and with our own (340s)-beliefs so so that''s very important and (343s)-we''re working on that and in other words (345s)-it''s almost the future is is potentially (348s)-a place where each person has their sort (351s)-of own customized AI that is specific to (355s)-what they care about and what they need (358s)-within certain bounds so there should be (360s)-some broad bounds and then the question (362s)-is what should they look like and this (365s)-is where we are working on Gathering (368s)-public input what should this heart (370s)-balance look like and Within These (372s)-higher bounds you can have a lot of (375s)-choice in having your own AI represent (377s)-your own beliefs and your own values (382s)-are there negative consequences we need (384s)-to be thinking about (386s)-I think there are (388s)-massive potential negative consequences (391s)-whenever you build something so powerful (393s)-with which so much good (396s)-can come (398s)-I think a long side it carries the (402s)-possibility of big harms as well and (407s)-that''s why you know we exist and that''s (409s)-why we''re we''re trying to uh (414s)-figure out how to deploy these systems (417s)-responsibly but I think the potential (420s)-for good is huge why put this out for (423s)-the world to start playing with to start (425s)-using when we don''t know where this is (428s)-heading you mean like why develop AI at (431s)-all why develop AI in the first place (433s)-and then why put it out for the world to (435s)-use before we know that we are (438s)-safeguarded that those guardrails are in (440s)-place already this will be the the (442s)-greatest technology Humanity has yet (444s)-developed we can all have a an (446s)-incredible educator in our pocket that''s (448s)-customized for us that helps us learn (450s)-that helps us do what we want we can (452s)-have medical advice for everybody that (455s)-is beyond what we can get today we can (458s)-have creative tools that help us figure (460s)-out the new problems we want to solve (461s)-wonderful new things to co-create with (463s)-this technology for Humanity we have (466s)-this idea of a co-pilot this tool that (469s)-today we help people write computer code (471s)-and they love it we can have that for (473s)-every profession and and we can have a (476s)-much higher quality of life like (478s)-standard of living as you point out (480s)-there''s a huge (481s)-uh there is huge potential downside (484s)-people need time to (486s)-update to react to get used to this (489s)-technology to understand where the the (493s)-downsides are and and what the (495s)-mitigations can be (496s)-if we just develop this in secret in our (499s)-little lab here and didn''t give (502s)-didn''t have contact with reality (504s)-and made gpt7 (506s)-and then drop that on the world all at (508s)-once that I think is a situation with a (511s)-lot more downside is there a kill switch (513s)-a way to shut the whole thing down yes (516s)-what really happens is like any engineer (518s)-can just say like we''re going to disable (520s)-this for now or we''re going to deploy (522s)-this new version of the model a human (523s)-yeah the model itself (526s)-can it take the place of that human (528s)-could could it become more powerful than (531s)-that human the uh so in the Sci-Fi (534s)-movies yes in in our world and the way (537s)-we''re doing things this model is you (539s)-know it''s sitting on a server it waits (541s)-until someone gives it an input (543s)-but you raise an important point which (546s)-is the humans who are in control of the (549s)-machine right now also have a huge (551s)-amount of power we do worry a lot about (554s)-authoritarian governments developing (556s)-this Putin has himself said whoever wins (559s)-this artificial intelligence race is (562s)-essentially the controller of humankind (564s)-do you agree with that so that was a (566s)-chilling statement for sure what I hope (568s)-instead is that we successfully develop (570s)-more and more powerful systems that we (573s)-can all use in different ways that get (574s)-integrated into our daily lives into the (577s)-economy and and become an amplifier of (579s)-human will but not this autonomous (581s)-system that is the single controller (584s)-essentially got really don''t want that (585s)-what should people not be using it for (588s)-right now the thing that I try to (590s)-caution people the most is what we call (592s)-the hallucinations problem (593s)-the model will confidently state things (596s)-as if they were facts that are entirely (597s)-made up and the more you use the model (600s)-because it''s right so often the more you (603s)-come to just rely on it and and not (605s)-check like ah this is just a language (607s)-model does chat gbt does artificial (611s)-intelligence create more truth in the (614s)-world (614s)-or more untruth in the world oh I think (617s)-we''re on a trajectory for it to create (619s)-much more truth in the world if there''s (621s)-a bunch of misinformation fed into the (623s)-model isn''t going to isn''t it going to (625s)-spit out more misinformation great (626s)-question I think the right way to think (628s)-of the models that we create (630s)-um is a reasoning engine not a fact (632s)-database they can also act as a fact (635s)-database but that''s not really what''s (636s)-special about them well we''re training (638s)-these models to do is something closer (641s)-to what we want them to do with (643s)-something closer to the ability to (644s)-reason not to memorize all of these (646s)-capabilities (648s)-could wipe out millions of jobs (651s)-if a machine can reason (654s)-then what do you need a human for a lot (656s)-of stuff it turns out one of the things (659s)-that we are trying to push the (661s)-technology trajectory towards and also (663s)-the way we build these products is to be (666s)-a tool for humans an amplifier of humans (669s)-and if you look at the way

the part that I worry (718s)-about the most but if this happens you (721s)-know in a single digit number of years (723s)-some of these shifts that that is the (725s)-part I worry about the most (726s)-could it tell me how to build a bomb it (729s)-shouldn''t tell you how to build a bomb (731s)-but even though Google searched well no (732s)-no we put we put constraints so if you (734s)-go ask it to tell you how to build a (736s)-bomb (737s)-um our version I don''t think we''ll do (738s)-that Google (740s)-already does (742s)-and so it''s not like this is something (743s)-that technology has not already made the (745s)-information available to but I think (747s)-that every incremental degree you make (750s)-that easier is something to avoid a (753s)-thing that I do worry about uh is we''re (755s)-not going to be the only creator of this (756s)-technology (757s)-there will be other people who don''t put (759s)-some of the safety limits that we put on (761s)-it Society I think has a limited amount (764s)-of time to figure out how to react to (766s)-that how to regulate that how to how to (768s)-handle it and how do you decide here at (772s)-open AI what goes in what shouldn''t (775s)-we have policy teams we have safety (778s)-teams we talk a lot to other groups in (781s)-the in the rest of the world (783s)-um we finished GPT for a very long time (785s)-ago it feels like a very long time ago (787s)-in this industry I think like seven (789s)-months ago something like that (790s)-um and since then we have been (792s)-internally externally talking to people (795s)-trying to make these decisions working (797s)-with red teamers talking to various (799s)-policy and safety experts getting audits (802s)-of the system to try to address these (804s)-issues and put something out that we (806s)-think is safe and good and who should be (809s)-defining those guard rails for society (811s)-Society should one society as a whole (814s)-how are we going to do that so I can (817s)-paint like a vision that I I find (819s)-compelling this will be one one way of (821s)-many that it could go (823s)-um if you had representatives from Major (826s)-World governments uh you know trusted (828s)-International institutions come together (830s)-and write a governing document you know (833s)-here is what the system should do here''s (836s)-what the system shouldn''t do here''s you (838s)-know very dangerous things that the (839s)-system should never touch even in a mode (841s)-where it''s creatively exploring (844s)-um and then developers of language (846s)-models like us use that as the governing (849s)-document you''ve said AI will likely (852s)-eliminate millions of jobs it could (854s)-increase racial bias misinformation (856s)-create machines that are smarter than (859s)-all of humanity combined (861s)-and other consequences so terrible we (864s)-can''t even imagine what they could be (867s)-many people are going to ask why on (870s)-Earth did you create this technology why (873s)-Sam (874s)-I think it can do the opposite of all of (876s)-those things too properly done it is (878s)-going to eliminate a lot of current jobs (880s)-that''s true (881s)-we can make much better ones so talking (884s)-about the downsides acknowledging the (885s)-downsides trying to avoid those while we (888s)-push in the direction of the upsides I (890s)-think that''s important and again very (892s)-early preview like would you push a (894s)-button to stop us if it meant we are no (896s)-longer able to cure all diseases would (898s)-you push a button to stop this if it (899s)-meant we couldn''t educate every child in (902s)-the world super well would you push a (903s)-button to stop this if it meant there (906s)-was a five percent chance it would be (907s)-the end of the world I would push a (909s)-button to slow it down and in fact I (911s)-think we will need to figure out ways to (913s)-slow down this technology over time 2024 (917s)-the next major election in the United (919s)-States (920s)-might not be on everyone''s mind but it (923s)-certainly is on yours (925s)-is this technology (928s)-going to have the kind of impact that (929s)-maybe social media has had on previous (931s)-elections and how can you guarantee (933s)-there won''t be those kind of problems (935s)-because of chat gbt (937s)-we don''t know is the honest answer we''re (939s)-monitoring very closely and and again we (942s)-can take it back we can turn things off (944s)-we can change the rules is this a Google (946s)-killer will people say I''m going to chat (948s)-gbt yet instead of Google it in the (950s)-future I think if you''re thinking about (951s)-this as search it''s sort of the wrong (954s)-framework I have no doubt that there (956s)-will be some things that people used to (958s)-do on Google that they do in touch EBT (960s)-but I think it''s a fundamentally (961s)-different kind of product Elon Musk (963s)-who''s an early investor in your company (965s)-he since left (967s)-um he has called out some of the chat (970s)-gbt inaccuracies and he tweeted recently (972s)-what we need is truth GPT is he right I (976s)-think he is right and that we want these (978s)-systems to tell the truth but I don''t (982s)-know the full context of that tweet and (984s)-I suspect but yeah I don''t think I know (987s)-what it''s referring to you when he speak (988s)-anymore we do and what does he say to (990s)-you off off the Twitter (994s)-um I have tremendous respect for Elon I (997s)-you know obviously we have some (998s)-different opinions about how (1000s)-AI should go but I think we (1002s)-fundamentally agree on more than we (1003s)-disagree on what do you think you agree (1005s)-most about (1006s)-that getting this technology right and (1009s)-figuring out how to navigate the risks (1012s)-is super important to the future of (1014s)-humanity how will you know if you got it (1017s)-right (1017s)-one simple way is if if most people (1020s)-think they''re much better off than they (1023s)-were before we put the technology out (1026s)-into the world that would be an (1027s)-indication we got it right you know a (1029s)-lot of people think science fiction yeah (1031s)-when they think chat GPT can you keep it (1034s)-so that these are truly closed systems (1037s)-that don''t become more powerful than we (1040s)-are as human beings communicate with (1041s)-each other and plan our destruction it''s (1044s)-so tempting to anthropomorphize Chachi (1047s)-Beauty but I think it''s important to (1048s)-talk about what it''s not as much as what (1050s)-it is (1051s)-and (1052s)-it because deep in our biology we are (1057s)-programmed to respond to someone talking (1060s)-to us (1061s)-you talk to chat GPT which you know (1063s)-really you''re talking to this (1064s)-Transformer (1065s)-somewhere in a cloud and it''s trying to (1067s)-predict the next word in a token and (1069s)-give it to you back (1070s)-but it''s so tempting to anthropomorphize (1073s)-that and think that this is like (1075s)-and and like a entity a sentient being (1078s)-that I''m talking to and it''s gonna go do (1081s)-its own thing and have its own will and (1083s)-you know plan with others but it can''t (1085s)-it can''t could it (1088s)-there I can imagine in the far future (1090s)-other versions of artificial (1092s)-intelligence different setups that are (1095s)-not a large language model that could do (1096s)-that it really took a decade plus of (1099s)-social media being out in the world for (1101s)-us to sort of realize and even (1103s)-characterize some of the real downsides (1106s)-of it how should we be measuring it here (1109s)-with AI (1110s)-there''s a number of new organizations (1112s)-starting and I expect relatively soon (1114s)-there will be new governmental (1115s)-departments or commissions or groups (1117s)-starting is the government prepared for (1119s)-this (1120s)-they are beginning to really pay (1122s)-attention which I think is great and I (1124s)-think this is another reason that''s (1125s)-important to put these Technologies out (1127s)-into the world we really need the (1129s)-government''s attention we really need (1131s)-thoughtful policy here and that takes a (1132s)-while to do (1135s)-right now to protect people and protect (1138s)-from the downside of this technology (1140s)-what should they do the main thing I (1142s)-would like to see the government do (1143s)-today is really come up to speed quickly (1146s)-on understanding what''s happening get (1148s)-insight into the top efforts where our (1151s)-capabilities are what we''re doing and I (1153s)-think that could start right now are you (1155s)-speaking to the government you''re in (1157s)-regular content regular contact and do (1159s)-you think they get it more and more (1161s)-every day when it comes to schools you (1165s)-have this this technology can beat most (1169s)-humans at the SATs the bar exam (1172s)-how should schools be integrating this (1174s)-technology in a way that doesn''t (1177s)-increase cheating that doesn''t increase (1179s)-laziness among students (1182s)-education is going to have to change but (1185s)-it''s happened many other times with (1186s)-technology when we got the calculator (1188s)-the way we taught math and what we (1189s)-tested students on that totally changed (1192s)-the (1194s)-the promise of this technology one of (1196s)-the ones that I''m most excited about is (1198s)-the ability to provide individual (1200s)-learning great individual learning for (1203s)-each student you''re already seeing (1205s)-students using chatgpt for this in a (1207s)-very primitive way to great success and (1209s)-as companies take our technology and (1212s)-create dedicated platforms for this kind (1214s)-of learning I think it will (1216s)-revolutionize education and I think that (1218s)-kids that are starting (1220s)-the education process today by the time (1222s)-they graduate from high school are going (1224s)-to be like smarter and more capable than (1225s)-we can imagine it''s a little better than (1227s)-a TI-85 it''s a little better uh but but (1230s)-it is it does (1232s)-put a lot of pressure on teachers (1235s)-to read for example if they''ve assigned (1238s)-an essay (1239s)-three of their students use chat GPT to (1241s)-write that essay how are they going to (1243s)-figure that out I''ve talked to a lot of (1245s)-teachers about this and it is true that (1247s)-it puts pressure in some ways but for an (1250s)-overworked teacher to be able to say hey (1252s)-go use chanchi PT to learn this concept (1254s)-that you''re you''re struggling with and

(33s)-if life has to happen we have to earn (36s)-the necessary capability (38s)-and our capabilities are fundamentally (40s)-dependent upon how intelligently we can (42s)-function in every situation in our life (45s)-and that fundamentally depends on how (48s)-well connected our brain is (52s)-in ancient times in this country in this (55s)-culture the elaborate systems as to how (58s)-to train the (60s)-reign (62s)-how to wire the brain as intensely as (65s)-possible (66s)-there are people it is a very beautiful (69s)-instance which happened (71s)-in 1930s (76s)-you have heard people going into long (78s)-chantings maybe in the temple or (81s)-somewhere have you heard people doing (82s)-hormones and all chanting and chanting (84s)-away for hours together (87s)-so this chanting was used to wire the (90s)-brain in a very big way because the (92s)-sounds that you employ has a big impact (95s)-on what happens in the brain (97s)-so these mantras were structured as (100s)-certain mathematics is involved in this (103s)-and a certain poetry is also involved in (105s)-it at the same time (107s)-because of using a certain level of (110s)-structured sounds it wired their brains (112s)-so much (114s)-that they have a phenomenal sense of (116s)-memory which is almost humanly (119s)-impossible (120s)-normally in modern times we consider (123s)-these things humanly impossible they had (125s)-that kind of memory because of using (127s)-these sounds in a particular way (130s)-this happened (132s)-to people went to Banaras friends (138s)-they were having a bath in the river and (141s)-among themselves they were talking (143s)-and they were making a business deal (146s)-so it was agreed that one friend offered (151s)-50 000 Rupees to the other friend to do (154s)-business (156s)-so right there verbally orally they made (158s)-a agreement (160s)-and it was done (163s)-and after a few years (165s)-because there was no written paper when (168s)-this man wanted the money back the other (170s)-man said you never gave it to me (172s)-no such thing happened (174s)-so he went to the court when he went to (177s)-the court he had no proof he said I have (179s)-given the money but he had no proof (181s)-then the judge said you have to get some (184s)-proof otherwise (186s)-we cannot do anything about it then he (189s)-remembered when they were in the river (193s)-they saw (195s)-Abraham and priest who was having birth (197s)-close to them so he just hoped that (201s)-maybe he would have heard what we spoke (203s)-and I can bring him as a witness (206s)-so he went looking for that man in (208s)-Banaras he found the man (211s)-and to his disappointment he realized (213s)-that the man did not know English these (215s)-people were talking in English language (216s)-and this priest did not know English (219s)-language (220s)-so he thought this is no good (223s)-then the Brahman asked why (225s)-then he told him see four years ago we (228s)-were having bath and you were also there (230s)-I was just hoping that I could use you (233s)-as a witness (235s)-the Brahman said okay I can repeat (237s)-whatever you said whatever you two had (239s)-conversation I can repeat that (241s)-he does not know English language but he (244s)-repeated every word of what they said (249s)-he just remembered every sound what they (253s)-uttered he did not know the meaning of (254s)-it he did not know the language but he (257s)-could repeat every word what they said (259s)-and he was brought to the court and he (261s)-won the case (264s)-so our memory and our ability to do (267s)-things can be so greatly enhanced if (270s)-only we handle this inner situation (272s)-right and one simple thing to do (276s)-if all of you are willing we can bring (278s)-many more steps into it but one simple (281s)-thing to start with is learning to be (283s)-just still (284s)-if you sit somewhere (286s)-simply learning to just sit absolutely (289s)-still (290s)-and moving just sitting still you will (294s)-see your ability to grasp and your (296s)-ability to use the brain will be greatly (298s)-enhanced (300s)-so I want you to understand this (304s)-everything that you see (306s)-hear smell taste and touch (310s)-is recorded (312s)-your memory problems are only your (314s)-ability to (316s)-bring it back when you need (318s)-there''s no recording problem (320s)-it is recording everything (323s)-but you are not able to pick out what (325s)-you want if you want to pick this out (326s)-something else is coming (329s)-so that is just a question of clarity (331s)-not of memory (334s)-memory means suppose if we say this (337s)-phone has low memory what does it mean (340s)-it has limited capability to record (342s)-isn''t it (345s)-if I press 2 if fire comes (348s)-what does it mean bad memory (351s)-or bad keyboard (354s)-bad keyboard so this is a question of (357s)-bad keyboard (358s)-is not a question of bad memory (360s)-it''s very important that you''ll you call (364s)-2-2 not far (368s)-it is a question of bad keyboard don''t (371s)-try to fix the memory memory is great (374s)-everything that you see is recorded (376s)-you''re not able to type out the right (379s)-number (380s)-that''s all the problem is isn''t it (383s)-so this is not a question of memory this (386s)-is a question of clarity (388s)-so we have to work on Clarity what is it (391s)-that gives us Clarity of mind (395s)-first thing is we learn to if if our (399s)-Clarity is not not good by itself (402s)-the simple thing is (404s)-handle things with a certain (407s)-precision (414s)- (426s)-where your feet should be prepared (429s)-not here like this where your hand (432s)-should be like this (435s)-it''s not proper (437s)- (441s)-inserting all this my head is looking (443s)-down oh not like this (446s)-like this (448s)-precision (450s)-now you come down when you sit down (453s)-you watch this okay how your pants (456s)-should be like this (460s)-whatever you brought with you your book (462s)-where your notebook should sit where you (465s)-spend suits it they should sit just (467s)-practice this (468s)-with every little thing just bring the (471s)-Precision into your activity it will (474s)-happen in your mind (476s)-you will see then if I say this it goes (480s)-to number two it won''t go to five (485s)-yes (487s)-now gets confused so handle it slowly (490s)-two three one (494s)-okay two is here 3 is here one is here (498s)-you just do this with every aspect of (500s)-your life (501s)-you go to bed how it should be (504s)-everything (506s)-you go in your room how it should be (509s)-just bring this meticulousness of what (512s)-you''re doing with the Asana into your (513s)-life you will see slowly mind will (517s)-become very very clear it becomes (519s)-meticulous with everything (521s)-the simple practice that you have to do (523s)-from this moment when you stand up when (526s)-you sit down when you walk and when you (529s)-go out here (530s)-you just look like this like you''re (532s)-doing what (535s)-chandrasana like this (537s)-how many columns in this (540s)-don''t try to count all of them the first (542s)-row if you simply look like this oh it''s (546s)-five columns (549s)-just you must register this five columns (553s)-one vessel (555s)-one sitting Rock one big rock one Pond (559s)-another three another four columns one (562s)-door how tall looks like twelve feet (566s)-just do this (568s)-with everything how many steps from here (571s)-to there don''t count like one two like (574s)-this (576s)-oh after you take three steps okay (579s)-that''s I think three (580s)-another three another three another (582s)-three (583s)-after a few days count eleven (587s)-or fourth or five (590s)-just like that without thinking you must (592s)-slowly know that okay I think I work 12 (596s)-steps (598s)-this is yoga (601s)-the this effect will happen over a (603s)-period of time by itself but now we are (606s)-in a hurry (607s)-so use the mind also (610s)-to do it to bring the Precision what (612s)-you''re trying to bring in your body (614s)-bring that Precision in your mind also (616s)-let the Mind imitate the body (619s)-you will see Clarity will naturally come (622s)-memory is not the problem everything is (624s)-anywhere recorded (629s)-I will abuse you right now (632s)-I''m going to abuse you badly (634s)-try to forget it (639s)-will you for all your life you''ll (641s)-remember it (643s)-yes or no so you got great memory you (646s)-just remember bad words that''s all (654s)- (657s)-if you exercise your mind like this (661s)-it''ll become in such a way (663s)-that you can make it do what you want (666s)-you will see slowly mind will become (669s)-very very clear (671s)- (673s)-when your mind is single pointed it''s a (675s)-powerful instrument (678s)-this is something that you do within (680s)-yourself (681s)-so that you''re able to slip behind the (684s)-mind (686s)-if we know who is behind the mirror then (689s)-we can change everything (690s)- (693s)- (695s)- (704s)- (715s)-foreign (716s)- ", "start": 2, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration":

average sales price of four (98s)-dollars and ten cents they''ve likely (100s)-generated over three hundred and (101s)-thirteen thousand dollars in profit (103s)-before Etsy fees and ads if they ran any (106s)-the next shop on our list is called (108s)-North Prince they''re selling vintage or (110s)-rustic style downloads and they have a (112s)-lot of Botanical and sketch type prints (114s)-and

got their (137s)-first review on August 12th which means (139s)-this shop has likely only been open for (141s)-about two and a half years that means (143s)-they''re doing about three hundred and

[{"text": "(240s)-options when it comes to getting art (241s)-even if you''re not an artist and I''m (243s)-going to go over three proven methods (245s)-the first completely free option is (247s)-selling public domain art because there (249s)-isn''t any kind of copyright on it and (250s)-I''ll show you a shop that''s successfully (252s)-selling this kind of public domain art (253s)-in just a second we could try selling (255s)-images off a free stock photo website (257s)-like unsplash pixabay or pixels but we (260s)-would have to be careful here because (262s)-even though we''re allowed to use these (263s)-images for commercial use we have to add (266s)-significant modification to the images (267s)-which makes sense because we don''t want (269s)-to just steal the images from the (271s)-photographers we could just buy pre-made (273s)-art on a platform like creative markets (275s)-but this can get expensive however these (278s)-images are pretty good just remember (280s)-here that even if you spent like a (281s)-thousand dollars on prints that you (283s)-could sell you''re asking to start a (284s)-business that makes you twenty thousand (286s)-dollars a month so just keep that (288s)-perspective in mind now those are all (290s)-great options and they do work and I''ll (292s)-show you more proof in a minute but (294s)-today''s video is about mid-journey (297s)- (299s)-mid-journey is an image generation AI (301s)-that lets you generate images like these (303s)-from a single prompt now mid journey is (306s)-free for the first few image Generations (307s)-but to sell the image we''ll need a (309s)-commercial license the standard plan (311s)-gives you unlimited image Generations (313s)-each month and General commercial terms (315s)-for only 30 bucks a month to access (317s)-mid-journey you''ll need a free Discord (319s)-account and you''ll have to download it (320s)-to your computer next you''ll just head (322s)-to the mid Journey website and click (323s)-join the beta and it should open the mid (325s)-Journey server in your Discord app ready (327s)-to generate some images now I''m going to (329s)-chat with the Discord privatebot to make (331s)-it a little easier to follow along so (333s)-right down here is where we can start (334s)-generating the images if I just type a (336s)-forward slash key and click on the (338s)-Imagine prompt right in here is where I (341s)-can type in my prompt so I''m just going (343s)-to type out simple palm tree and then (346s)-I''m going to add a two dashes and then (348s)-type AR which is for aspect ratio and (351s)-python 2x3 and after I hit enter it''s (354s)-just going to begin generating me those (355s)-images now it''s really important that we (357s)-generate the images with that aspect (359s)-ratio CO2 by 3 so that we can use them (361s)-as posters and right before your eyes it (364s)-will begin painting you a completely new (366s)-image based on your prompt if we don''t (367s)-like any of them we can just click the (369s)-re-roll button and it''ll give us four (370s)-more options to choose from this will (372s)-give us four variations based on the (374s)-same prompt but if we want something (375s)-completely different we could just give (377s)-it a brand new prompt after we have our (379s)-four Images we just hit the (381s)-corresponding upscale button and it will (383s)-make the image larger and once it''s done (385s)-upscaling the first time we will have to (387s)-click the beta upscale redo to make it (389s)-even larger so it''s big enough for our (391s)-customers to print now I''ll show you (393s)-several more images in a minute to show (394s)-you that it is possible to get (396s)-comparable art to that shop we looked at (397s)-at the beginning okay so I think this (399s)-one turned out the best once it''s done (401s)-upscaling to the beta size we just have (403s)-to click on it and click open in browser (405s)-now this will open it up in your web (406s)-browser from here all you have to do is (408s)-right click and save the image we can (410s)-give it a name and just hit save now (412s)-we''ve generated an image that we could (414s)-sell and they could print it as a 20 by (416s)-30 or a two by three aspect ratio but (419s)-there are some other aspect ratios we (420s)-should offer so the customers can pick (422s)-exactly what''s best for their situation (424s)-so in my web browser I''ve opened up this (426s)-website called photo p and it''s (429s)-essentially just a Photoshop replacement (430s)-that''s completely free if you saw the AI (433s)-sticker video I did then you''ll already (434s)-be familiar with this platform and right (436s)-below the Subscribe button I''ll leave (438s)-links to all of these websites and (439s)-platforms that we''re using now the first (441s)-thing we''re going to want to do when we (442s)-have photo P open is click and create a (445s)-new project and up here in the settings (447s)-we want the width to be 20 the height to (449s)-be 30 and DPI to be 300. from there we (453s)-can just click create and now we''re (454s)-ready to just drag our palm tree image (456s)-or whatever image we created right on to (458s)-the surface and from here we just want (460s)-to scale it up next we want to just make (463s)-sure that we turn off this white (464s)-background layer and make sure that our (467s)-design layer is selected from there (469s)-we''re going to come over to the left (471s)-hand side and click on the crop tool (473s)-we''re going to change the dimensions to (476s)-a fixed ratio and right up here is where (478s)-we''re going to put our aspect ratio now (480s)-you can pause the video here because (482s)-these are the ratios that we''re going to (483s)-be selling to make variations it''s super (485s)-easy we just have to set the crop to (488s)-whatever our aspect ratio is so in this (490s)-example 11 by 14 and you can see how it (494s)-Alters the image from here we just have (495s)-to click this little check mark then in (497s)-the top left corner we''re going to come (499s)-choose file export as and choose JPEG (502s)-and now you can see we have a (504s)-beautifully cropped 11 by 14 inch palm (506s)-tree we then just have to come back into (508s)-photo p and hit command Z to undo our (510s)-changes and from there we can start the (512s)-process Over Again by selecting the crop (515s)-tool and we''re going to go through and (517s)-make iterations of every single aspect (519s)-ratio we''re selling now that our images (520s)-are prepared there''s just a couple more (522s)-steps to get them ready to start selling (524s)-now since our prints are going to be a (526s)-little too big to upload directly to (528s)-Etsy we''re going to use that Gmail (529s)-account we created earlier and upload (531s)-the files to Google Drive once you''ve (532s)-navigated to your Google Drive all you (535s)-have to do is simply drag your folder (537s)-and drop it directly in and it''ll start (539s)-uploading now while our file is (541s)-uploading we only have one final step (543s)-that we have to do to get this ready for (545s)-our customer to download we are super (547s)-close to the finish line right now the (548s)-last free program we''re going to be (550s)-using is called figma and once you''ve (552s)-signed up and created a blank document (554s)-all we have to do is drag in one of our (557s)-images so I''m just going to drag in my (559s)-palm tree right here next all we have to (561s)-do is click on this text box and click (564s)-somewhere on the board and we just want (566s)-to type in download here then we just (568s)-need to change the font size so that (570s)-it''s legible and change it to something (572s)-nice you might add a drop shadow or (574s)-something and this is going to be the (576s)-download link that the customer clicks (577s)-on to get all of their files so the (579s)-final step is to come back into our (581s)-Google Drive and with our folder right (583s)-here we''re just going to right click (585s)-and we want to click get link then we (587s)-want to change this to anyone with a (589s)-link and make sure that this drop down (591s)-is set to viewer then we can just click (593s)-copy link and when we come back in figma (595s)-if we just double click and select our (598s)-text layer and hit command V to paste it (601s)-in it has pasted the link right into (603s)-that text and now our customers can use (606s)-this as a hyperlink to take them (607s)-directly to the download now the final (609s)-steps here are we have to select both (611s)-layers hit the command and G key on our (615s)-keyboard (616s)-and now when we click on export we can (619s)-change this to a PDF and we can export (622s)-the group so you can see that I''ve (624s)-titled it download here and when our (626s)-customer gets it and opens it up they''re (627s)-going to have this download link right (629s)-here which they can click on and it will (631s)-take them directly to the download page (633s)-where they can download all of the (634s)-images in exactly the aspect ratio that (637s)-they need okay all of the technical work (639s)-is done and now we just have to post a (641s)-listing in Etsy I just have to complete (643s)-all of the listing details and make sure (646s)-that I''m selecting digital download for (648s)-the type then I just take the PDF we (650s)-created with the download link and I (652s)-drag it to where it says upload file and (654s)-now it''s pretty much done the only thing (656s)-that we have to do is create a listing (657s)-image we can get a free poster mock-up (660s)-by going to rawpixel.com typing in (662s)-poster mock-up and they''ll give you (664s)-several options here but we want to (666s)-filter by free from here we can just (668s)-choose one that we like maybe this one (670s)-and then we just hit download it is (672s)-important to keep in mind that we will (673s)-have to copy this and put it in our (675s)-description if we using the free version (677s)-we can go back to photo p and just drag (679s)-in the mock-up that we just got off of (681s)-raw pixel and then in the file that says (683s)-your image here we''ll double click we''ll (685s)-drag in and resize our palm tree image (687s)-hit save and now you can see we have a (689s)-beautiful palm tree mock-up from here we (691s)-can use the same steps as before and (694s)-just export it as a JPEG and then with (696s)-that image we just created we can just (697s)-drag it right into Etsy and upload it as (699s)-the main photo and then assuming (701s)-everything else is set up correctly all (703s)-we''d have to do is just click publish to (706s)-our store now if you used my link down (707s)-below you won''t have to pay for the (709s)-listing fee otherwise each listing you (711s)-post costs about 20 cents and it (713s)-literally just like that we''ve (714s)-successfully created our first listing (716s)-now each time you repeat the process (718s)-you''d get a little bit faster and a (719s)-little bit better at generating images (721s)-you could use this exact strategy to (723s)-grow to twenty thousand dollars a month (725s)-in passive income you would just have to (727s)-put in the time and the work to get good (728s)-at doing this now you''ve seen me go (730s)-through this entire process but here''s (732s)-how I would actually execute if you find (734s)-yourself running out of ideas open up (736s)-the chat bot we used earlier called chat (738s)-GPT and ask it for a list of ideas or (740s)-sayings that you could use if you''re (742s)-selling posters with sayings on them (743s)-when it comes to picking a knee all of (745s)-the successful shops that we''ve looked (747s)-at have

are (22s)-seven things you need to know right now (24s)-first gpt4 stands for generative (26s)-pre-trained Transformer with the four (28s)-representing the Four Horsemen of the (30s)-Apocalypse it''s currently available to (31s)-try out today if you''re a Chad CPT Pro (34s)-member but API access is behind a wait (36s)-list big clients are already using it in (38s)-production like Microsoft Bing chat (40s)-Duolingo for language learning and at (42s)-Big Banks to help them not collapse the (44s)-second thing to know is that gpt4 is (46s)-smarter which is described in detail on (48s)-this paper like it past the bar exam in (50s)-the top 10 percent unlike gbt 3 which (53s)-was in the bottom 10 that''s great news (55s)-for Humanity because it''s thinking like (56s)-Shakespeare let''s kill all the lawyers (58s)-and not just that but it''s also asyn AP (60s)-exams which is good enough to get you (62s)-college credit when it comes to (63s)-programming questions on leak code it''s (65s)-able to solve the easy ones but still (66s)-fails for the most part on the medium (68s)-and hard questions it''s basically where (69s)-chess engines were at in the early 90s (71s)-good chess players could still beat the (73s)-engines back then but 10 years later (74s)-they didn''t have a chance third gpt4 can (77s)-now handle 25 000 input words compared (80s)-to about 3 000 for gpt3 this is huge (82s)-because it means you can feed the AI (84s)-more context relative to the task at (86s)-hand this is the feature that''s going to (87s)-make me homeless because now you can (89s)-take the documentation for any library (91s)-that you want to learn then prove the AI (93s)-for a step-by-step guide and it creates (95s)-the perfect tutorial in a matter of (97s)-months if not days we''ll start seeing (98s)-documentation pages with context aware (101s)-built-in tutorial generators they''ll (103s)-always be up to date even though gpt4''s (105s)-training cutoff was in 2021. for example (107s)-I asked it for a tutorial about angular (109s)-signals which is a new feature just (111s)-announced recently understandably its (113s)-initial response was not correct however (115s)-I went to the readme 4 angular signals (117s)-copied it and pasted it into my prompt (119s)-its respond was a near perfect tutorial (121s)-they took our job it did hallucinate an (124s)-npm package called signals but errors (126s)-like that will become more rare as (127s)-developers tailor their documentation (129s)-for these AI printers what''s crazy (131s)-though is that it can do the opposite (132s)-job as well in this example I wrote five (135s)-different functions and asked it to (136s)-document them for me it did a pretty (138s)-good job which means humans don''t even (139s)-really need to write docs anymore you (141s)-could also use it to analyze your code (143s)-like if you have a smart contract and (144s)-want to find security vulnerabilities or (146s)-it can translate code from one language (148s)-to another like a digital Rosetta Stone (150s)-in fact the website Rosetta code might (152s)-be just as obsolete as me now and just (154s)-wait a few months until gpt4 is (156s)-integrated into GitHub copilot it''ll be (158s)-capable of handling far more contacts to (160s)-make predictions that align with your (162s)-specific dependencies or possibly do (163s)-project-wide AI debugging if you''re not (165s)-careful the co-pilot may become the (167s)-captain but that''s not all the fourth (169s)-thing you need to know is that it''s a (171s)-multi-modal model that can also accept (173s)-images as an input like this dude (175s)-sketched out a website on a piece of (176s)-toilet paper then seconds later it (178s)-created a shitty website going from (180s)-hand-drawn beautiful art to working (183s)-website you''ll be able to take your (185s)-figma designs then generate a web (187s)-application for them in your favorite (188s)-framework actually screwfigma you might (190s)-as well just prove to Mid Journey for (192s)-your designs directly also with images (193s)-homework is completely obsolete now gpt3 (196s)-was already writing B grade term papers (198s)-but now kids can just take a screenshot (200s)-of their math problems and get a (202s)-solution in seconds however gpt4 does (204s)-have some drawbacks it''s noticeably (206s)-slower than other models so if the (207s)-response time is important you''ll likely (209s)-want to use a different model in (210s)-addition it''ll likely be expensive (211s)-especially if you''re providing a ton of (213s)-tokens as context because currently in (215s)-the API your build per token where a (218s)-token roughly equals one word the sixth (220s)-thing you should know is that it''s based (221s)-or at least diet woke people have (223s)-speculated that openai is coding a (225s)-political agenda into the AI because it (227s)-refused to write poems about Trump but (228s)-would do so about Biden the gpt4 though (230s)-didn''t hesitate to spit these bars for (232s)-Trump however it is 82 percent more (234s)-likely to deny a disallowed prompt which (236s)-is not good news for old friend do (238s)-anything now Dan which is sad because (240s)-the vast majority already of chat GPT (242s)-users are only there to trick it into (244s)-doing bad things and as a developer the (246s)-final thing you should know is that you (247s)-can now pass it a system message to (249s)-change its Behavior if you have access (251s)-to the API you can use this feature to (253s)-give your chatbot its own custom Persona (255s)-or context to solve a specific problem (257s)-the Earth is like a pancake flattest (259s)-candy not round like a ball believe you (261s)-me I have a whole video about the API on (263s)-my second Channel if you want to learn (264s)-more I keep telling myself I''m done (266s)-making videos about AI but every other (268s)-day some crazy new thing comes out that (270s)-the world is changing before our eyes (271s)-for better or worse I just want to say (273s)-that it''s been an honor and a privilege (275s)-learning how to code with you here on (276s)-YouTube but the writing is on the wall (278s)-the role of the programming teacher is (280s)-now obsolete I''m just a dial-up internet (281s)-connection in a world filled with 5G (283s)-Towers becoming an elite programmer is (285s)-no longer just about how well you can (287s)-Google stuff now it''s about how well you (289s)-can prove to the AI and that''s why you (291s)-should buy my AI protein masterclass (293s)-which will be available for an absurd (294s)-price as soon as gpt4 is finished (296s)-writing it and this has been the code (297s)-report thanks for

here with hello (28s)-today I want to create images with a (30s)-diffusion model I''m gonna feed you some (32s)-information about it okay (34s)-so that is good so the first thing I did (37s)-was I just went to Mid journey and I (39s)-copied all of this data on how it worked (41s)-but I didn''t want any response so I just (44s)-said but wait I have more info just (46s)-answer with read right so we get to read (48s)-back then I fed it all the information I (51s)-can find on the newest model that is (53s)-version 5 right I just found this on Mid (55s)-Journey''s homepage so I put all of this (58s)-into gbt4 right and again just answer (61s)-with red so I got the red hair and I (64s)-followed up with how you can set quality (67s)-chaos seed stop all the parameters you (70s)-can use in mid Journey so the chatgpt (73s)-knows that again I just want the real (75s)-answer I''ve added some compatibilities (78s)-information (80s)-read so now then I followed up it now I (83s)-want I will give you some examples of (85s)-prompt used in mid Journey V5 okay (88s)-so I went ahead I find prompts I liked (91s)-on the mid-journey homepage focused on (94s)-photography since that is our main focus (96s)-today so I just pasted in a whole bunch (99s)-of examples here I think it was five (101s)-and I followed up with would you say now (104s)-that you understand how mid-journey (106s)-Works yes or no (108s)-yes I understand how my Journey works (110s)-now okay so that''s good then I followed (113s)-up with five more prompts uh all of this (116s)-has some kind of Photography related (119s)-prompts because that''s what I want to do (120s)-in this video (122s)-and again I think I gave it six more (124s)-different prompts I just want to feel it (126s)-a lot of good examples of things I like (129s)-so I think that''s pretty important and (133s)-then I''m ready to just prime it so (135s)-basically now I just go great now I want (138s)-you to act as a professional (140s)-photographer you will use a rich and (142s)-descriptive language when describing (144s)-your photo prompts include camera setups (147s)-the first prompt I want you to create is (150s)-a photo of 1930s female influencer take (154s)-inspiration from the format formatting (156s)-from the example prompts don''t copy them (158s)-but use the same format (161s)-okay so that is basically how I prime (164s)-gpt4 two can put up mid-journey problems (167s)-I am happy with if you want a whole (169s)-prompt I just used to Prime gpt4 to get (171s)-ready for mid-journey follow the link in (173s)-description and sign up for my (175s)-newsletter you will find a PDF there (177s)-with the whole prompt inside and now (179s)-it''s basically just I just hit submit (181s)-and this is the first prompt we got so (184s)-basically let''s just copy all of this (186s)-and head over to Mid journey and check (189s)-out our first image so over here at Mid ", "start": 18, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1",

gpt4 I''m not gonna (195s)-do any changes so now it''s just to hit (198s)-enter okay so we got our first result (200s)-back so let''s take a closer look here so (203s)-you can see these were in the four five (205s)-format right wow this is amazing the (209s)-fingers are still messed up you can see (211s)-she has one extra finger here that''s a (214s)-bit funny but other than that look at (216s)-this (217s)-remember this is a 1930s female (221s)-influencer so the camera is probably (224s)-influenced by that (225s)-and I like that it''s an old camera (227s)-that''s great (229s)-and this looks very realistic right (232s)-also this pose here they''re all posing (235s)-for a camera I think (237s)-yeah this looks awesome very happy with (240s)-this so let''s take a look at something I (243s)-wanted to show you here so I just (245s)-created this quick photo list of photos (248s)-I want to do today so this is the 1930s (251s)-female influencer next I want to do (253s)-something with Vikings as you probably (255s)-saw in the thumbnail that was a viking (257s)-prompt so let''s just do that so I think (260s)-the first Viking prompt I want to do is (262s)-now generate a prompt of a (264s)-photorealistic portrait of a screaming (267s)-female viking so let''s try that (271s)-okay so that was the prompt let''s just (273s)-take a deeper look into our first prompt (276s)-I''m not gonna do this for everyone but (277s)-you can see a powerful vividly realistic (280s)-portrait of a fierce female Viking (283s)-Warrior mid Battle Cry her face (285s)-contorted with raw emotion and (287s)-determination as the fearlessly leads or (290s)-comrades into battle that''s a great (292s)-sentence right and you can see there''s (295s)-all that all of these camera settings (296s)-that we asked for we have the aperture (299s)-we have the lenses we have the iso we (302s)-have the shutter speed and it also adds (305s)-the aspect ratios the quality right that (309s)-is probably from our examples so I think (311s)-that''s very important too the Shadow the (314s)-shallow depth of field skillfully (316s)-isolates the Warrior from the chaotic (318s)-Battlefield in the background wow I''m (320s)-excited for this prompt so you can see (322s)-I''m leaving out V5 because that''s (324s)-automatic so I''m gonna copy all of this (326s)-and head over to Mid Journey wow this is (330s)-insane look look at this this is crazy (334s)-so where was this wow look at this (337s)-uh I might remember my camera is in the (339s)-way let me move this (341s)-this is insane look at the intensity in (344s)-the eyes and look at the details (346s)-oh my God look at this (349s)-I''m kind of scared looking at it damn (351s)-that''s impressive (354s)-I''ve got a speechless right now (357s)-this was (360s)-I didn''t expect this kind of quality (363s)-amazing but we gotta move on so let''s (366s)-head over to our next photo so now I (369s)-wanted to do a photo a prompt of the (373s)-perfect pasta dish so let me just run (375s)-that (378s)-okay so here we have the prompt I just (380s)-wanted to point point out one thing so (382s)-you can see we don''t mention anything of (384s)-a photo here but it still understands (387s)-from the examples I gave it with the (388s)-priming right that it should be a (390s)-photograph and it also picks the camera (392s)-aperture lenses shutter speed and (395s)-everything we need in a photo so that is (397s)-very good so let''s just go ahead and run (400s)-this okay so here we have it here is our (403s)-pasta dish and damn that looks good I (406s)-gotta say that looks very gummy so let''s (408s)-just blow that up look at the details (410s)-here you can see the Tomato you can see (412s)-the parmesan (414s)-I can''t really not understand that this (417s)-can (418s)-this has to be able to replace some kind (421s)-of food photograph photography isn''t (424s)-that really expensive to hire people to (426s)-capture food (428s)-so what if you just didn''t you just took (430s)-an image of your food on your restaurant (432s)-and fed this into the image to image and (435s)-then you get like an expanded or better (437s)-version of it look at the details here (440s)-it''s just crazy (441s)-with the flower or what it is on the (444s)-side here (445s)-you can see some kind of Parmesan has (447s)-fell off the plate (449s)-I''m just amazed by this (451s)-this is just insane this is I have to (454s)-say this looks really Next Level (456s)-very impressive (459s)-so what I thought we can do now instead (461s)-of me going through each prompt what I''m (463s)-gonna do now is just I''m gonna go to my (466s)-photo list here hope you can see this (469s)-and I''m just going to collect a whole (472s)-lot of different prompts but before I do (474s)-that I just wanted to show you one more (476s)-thing and that is uh I want to show you (478s)-as something I tried that worked pretty (481s)-well and that is changing up the input (483s)-prompt here to now generate a prompt of (486s)-your interpretation off and then you (488s)-just add something at the end here I''m (490s)-just gonna run that and I''m gonna (492s)-collect a whole lot of prompts from this (494s)-list and didn''t be just gonna look at (496s)-all of them in mid Journey okay so now (499s)-we have every single image I wanted to (501s)-collect so let''s just go over them one (503s)-by one so the first one we have is the (506s)-prompt was a viking shape sharpening his (509s)-blade so let''s take a look at this look (512s)-how realistic this is this is just (514s)-amazing I kind of can''t get over how (517s)-good the hair looks right that''s just it (520s)-looks perfect I guess the weapon and the (522s)-blades are a bit strange (524s)-but it''s so realistic look the headband (527s)-here is a bit off but other than that (529s)-and look at the background is blurry (532s)-this is just again look at that hair (534s)-that scar might be a bit off but look at (537s)-that hair how good it looks the fur is (539s)-amazing I''m just shocked how good is (542s)-this the fingers at least it has four (545s)-fingers but the skin looks a bit but I (547s)-kinda impressed by this wow it''s gonna (550s)-be a lot of fun playing around with this (552s)-okay so let''s move on to our next image (555s)-and that is going to be a a gladiator (557s)-hunting in the forest so let''s blow this (561s)-up again you can see it''s a bit off uh I (565s)-kind of like the ground here but the (566s)-face is kind of messed up uh this was (569s)-quite cool but the sword again it''s (571s)-messed up the shield has a blade but I (574s)-like the forest that''s good this may be (576s)-a bit off again that looks good The (578s)-Shield is maybe a bit off and there''s (580s)-something wrong on his head so it''s not (582s)-perfect but quite good I think this is (585s)-the best one uh it''s black and white (587s)-though but if it wasn''t for that bug (589s)-with the blade I think this will be (591s)-perfect kind of weird with the hat and (593s)-stuff so if I wanted the perfect image (595s)-of this I kind of had to do some reruns (597s)-I think (598s)-okay so let''s have a look at the next (600s)-one this is a good one this is a perfect (603s)-moment when a bee lands on a flower and (607s)-look at these details what can I say (609s)-look at the pollen here and look at the (611s)-details inside the beast''s eyes here and (615s)-the pollen and the fur you can really (617s)-see the fur here that''s just I can''t (620s)-really believe this is AI generated look (623s)-how good the fur looks here this is a (626s)-pure macro photo oh that''s good I can''t (629s)-believe how good the fur looks amazing (632s)-okay let''s move on and this was that GPT (637s)-Force interpretation of dreaming so (640s)-let''s blow it up I gotta say I really (642s)-like this it''s just so wholesome it''s so (646s)-peaceful there''s one one quite gross (648s)-thing here just three feet so let''s just (651s)-move on from that but look at this one (653s)-look how peaceful this is this too the (656s)-hands are a bit weird and there''s (658s)-something here but this I gotta say was (660s)-my favorite that''s just great remember (662s)-this was just the prompt was give me (664s)-your interpretation of dreaming right (667s)-okay so this was a good one this was (670s)-your interpretation of artificial (673s)-intelligence ruling over humans this (676s)-image is cool right there''s like a big (678s)-army of is it humans or is it AIS I (681s)-think it''s AIS or some robots (684s)-this was great (685s)-this looks like from a movie right you (688s)-see that this one is guarding over all (690s)-these humans here this was quite cool I (692s)-guess there are humans in the background (694s)-it''s a bit strange but I like the cyborg (697s)-robot here this is also very it''s a bit (700s)-creepy (702s)-but still this I just did this image I (705s)-didn''t redo any so that''s cool okay so (708s)-move on to this was a 19th 1950s female (712s)-police officer so let''s blow this up (715s)-perfect how good is this (718s)-you can see the eye is a bit off maybe (720s)-other than that there''s really nothing (723s)-to there''s no flaws here is it I can''t (726s)-really see any else (728s)-anything else that''s flawed here the (730s)-lips are perfect the eyes are good just (732s)-looking that way the hat is very good of (735s)-course the text over here is a bit messy (738s)-but yeah this is awesome okay so let''s (741s)-check our next prompt this was a (743s)-mysterious cabin in by the Fjord in (747s)-Norway (748s)-so I can kind of relate to this (751s)-I think this one was the best one (754s)-uh (755s)-because this is usually the style of (758s)-cabins we have here (759s)-so let me take a look at this one yeah (762s)-this two is quite good it''s not a (764s)-typical Fjord setup I guess it kinda is (767s)-still but disc cabins are rarely seen (770s)-this but it''s still good I like that (773s)-three zero green but on the other side (775s)-they are snowy that''s a bit strange (778s)-Maybe (779s)-this one is good the wall is a bit (781s)-strange but other than that perfect the (784s)-mountains just exactly as we have it (787s)-here and I like the reflection right the (789s)-reflection is perfect down in the water (791s)-on all images that''s very good nice okay (796s)-so this was (797s)-um (797s)-Star Wars inspired living room interior (801s)-remember I did a video on this with me (803s)-Journey 4. uh I don''t know if this is (806s)-improved I think there are more details (808s)-here and it look it looks great just (811s)-think of how many Architects or interior (814s)-designers can take advantage of this now (816s)-I know I''ve done a few videos on this (818s)-but (819s)-look at this (820s)-this was just the only prompt I ran and (823s)-it''s just awesome (825s)-crazy okay so the final one we have on (829s)-this video is an Iron Man inspired (832s)-sports car let''s blow this up (835s)-I like the one in the right corner here (838s)-the colors are spot on (841s)-the on the left top corner too that''s (843s)-very good I think I read somewhere that (846s)-um (847s)-some car designers now are using AI to (850s)-get the inspiration (852s)-and you can kind of see why because you (855s)-can create hundreds of this just to get (857s)-some inspiration wow crazy this was a (860s)-bit strange that the headlights are in (862s)-the back and the front (864s)-that''s a bit strange other than that I (867s)-think this one was the coolest awesome (869s)-so just a quick word on my first (872s)-impression of mid Journey five uh I (874s)-gotta say I''m really impressed I can''t (876s)-get over have good dose I think my (879s)-favorite images has to be the Viking (882s)-girl I can''t get over how good this (884s)-looks (885s)-it''s so realistic (888s)-it''s almost scary I guess the tongue (890s)-here is a bit of but yeah my first (892s)-impression is very good and I can''t wait (894s)-to get around to play more with it and I (897s)-think combining this with gpd4 can get (900s)-you some really good prompts so I (902s)-suggest you try it out so like I said in (905s)-the middle of the video if you want the (907s)-prompts I use the prime gpt4 just sign (909s)-up for my newsletter you can also check (911s)-out my membership in the description (913s)-below also check out this video here if (916s)-you enjoyed this one I think you''re (918s)-gonna like that and as always thank you

sometimes (25s)-about the context length or the context (27s)-window so I just wanted to quickly (29s)-address this and show you a bit what I (31s)-mean so we can say that thousand tokens (34s)-is about 750 words that''s like ish plus (37s)-minus and you can see here the changes (40s)-from chat GPT we went from 4 000 tokens (43s)-that''s the window to 8 000 tokens on one (46s)-version of gpt4 and we have a 32k (49s)-version too and as you can see here (50s)-that''s about 3 000 words in chat GPT and (55s)-25 000 words uh that''s the biggest one (57s)-32k right so how is actually the com (60s)-context window or context lengths (62s)-working so let''s take a look at that if (64s)-we head over here hopefully you can see (66s)-this now let me zoom in a bit so here (68s)-you can see we have chat TPT we have 4 (70s)-000 tokens here we have the same 32 (73s)-cables in here and we put in here right (76s)-4000 tokens and you can see here on the (79s)-top here I put my YouTube channel is all (81s)-about AI I do that on both places right (85s)-and if I go down here now and I type in (88s)-in let''s say chat gbt or gpt4 uh what is (92s)-my YouTube channel name your YouTube (94s)-channel name is all about the eye so the (97s)-model now can look in this window (100s)-it still has access to every (102s)-context here because it''s under 4K or 4K (106s)-tokens so it can still understand that (108s)-my YouTube channel is all about AI so (111s)-what happens if we move on to let''s say (115s)-we add yeah you can say this right it''s (118s)-good you can see we add 6 000 tokens (121s)-here now so we have 6 000 tokens here (123s)-and we have the same here right but now (126s)-you can see this part now ends up (129s)-outside the token window right so my (132s)-YouTube channel is all about AI it''s it (135s)-ends out outside the token window (137s)-because chat GPD only can handle four (139s)-thousand tokens right (141s)-so when we go to and ask what is my (145s)-YouTube channel name it''s just gonna (147s)-reply something like I can''t find any (148s)-information about any YouTube channel (150s)-right (151s)-but if we have the 32k version that''s no (154s)-problem this is still way inside the (156s)-context window so here we get the (158s)-correct answer right and that is (160s)-basically what I want to show you (162s)-because I''ve seen there''s been some (163s)-confusion about this uh but also you got (166s)-to remember that the (168s)-input and the output is the window right (172s)-so if you put in 10 000 tokens and you (176s)-get 10 000 back as an answer then the (179s)-context window then you have added 20 (181s)-000 tokens right so I think this gave (183s)-you some information about how the (186s)-context window work so we''re gonna take (189s)-a closer look at some use cases now so ", "start": 21, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 170}]}, {"chapter_start": 191, "chapter_title": "GPT-4 Prompt Engineering Use Case 1 - Blog Posts", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(192s)-the first thing I want to do is just (193s)-take my latest YouTube video and turn it (196s)-into a blog post or an article call it (198s)-what you want just by using the big (201s)-context window we got in gpt4 so I''m (204s)-just gonna show you how I do this so the (207s)-first step was to just take my YouTube (209s)-video and turn it into an MP3 file so we (211s)-only have the audio then I went over to (214s)-this very simple python script I created (216s)-here with open a eyes whisper that is (219s)-basically just a transcribe API just put (222s)-my file name here.mp3 and when I run (225s)-this I will get every word I said in the (228s)-video in text form right so basically (231s)-I''m just gonna run this now and let this (233s)-finish okay so that was done took about (236s)-I don''t know 45 seconds you can see here (238s)-now we have a text file here (241s)-with every single word I said in the (243s)-video so that''s perfect so we can use in (246s)-gpt4 now let''s move on to the second (249s)-step and that is just gonna be head over (251s)-to my website and copy every single word (254s)-for a similar article I have written (256s)-before so I get the format style right (258s)-just copy all of that and just paste it (261s)-into a Word document and then we can do (263s)-our final step and that is gonna be (266s)-heading over to Mid Journey''s homepage (268s)-I''m just gonna copy some information (269s)-here about their newest model version 5 (273s)-because I think we need some context for (275s)-the article or blog post and that is (278s)-basically all I need and now let''s head (280s)-over to gpt4 so I didn''t want to waste (283s)-your time so I just went ahead and (285s)-prepared this so I just started with (288s)-here''s some info I want you to read then (290s)-I pasted in the whole previous old (293s)-article I have written so I get the (295s)-format down right that was basically the (297s)-whole article and it just just answer me (300s)-with red if you have read article so we (301s)-just get back that this helps us save (304s)-tokens right if gpt4 is going to give us (307s)-a big answer back from everything we put (310s)-in then we''re just gonna lose some (312s)-tokens this is a way to save some tokens (314s)-and here are some information about mid (316s)-Journey 5 I just put in some info here (319s)-about major Journey 5 we get a red back (321s)-and here is some more information I want (324s)-you to read (325s)-and this was basically you remember my (328s)-transcript so here you can see this is (330s)-every word I said in the video so just (333s)-fed That Into gpt4 You can see how long (336s)-this is and it still can read it right (338s)-then I go on to create my prompt so here (341s)-I just go now with all the information (344s)-you have read I want you to write an (346s)-in-depth article named gpt4 plus mid (350s)-Journey V5 the future of photo in the (353s)-style of our ioscope when Tech writer (356s)-include details from the information I (359s)-gave you above okay so that''s a good (361s)-start I think and you can see here the (364s)-title future of Photography so it (367s)-changed that a bit got some subtitles we (369s)-got a I think it was an okay (371s)-introduction we got section one that was (373s)-gpt4 and Midian was a match a match made (377s)-in Tech heaven and it just talked a bit (379s)-about gpt4 and mid joining V5 and (382s)-showcasing the power and we got the (384s)-impact of the photograph industry and we (386s)-ended up with our conclusion and I read (388s)-through this and it was quite good (390s)-actually it only used from our context (393s)-window above this is pretty much not (395s)-using nothing from the foundation model (397s)-and I think I can say that basically (400s)-this content that the AI wrote for me or (403s)-gbd4 wrote for me is pretty much my own (406s)-content since I generated the video (408s)-right but I wasn''t too happy about (411s)-section one so I just continued great (413s)-can you elaborate more on section one (415s)-include more about gpt4 priming so (418s)-that''s what I really wanted to going in (420s)-the article because I wanted to talk (421s)-more about gbd4 priming and then it did (424s)-a really good job this this section was (427s)-very very good it went deep into priming (431s)-gpt4 for optimal prompt generation I''m (433s)-Gonna Leave a link to this so you can (435s)-read it if you want to and it was (436s)-building constant contextual (438s)-understanding that''s important crafting (440s)-detailed prompts iterative refinement (443s)-and this was a very good section so I (446s)-read through all of this and basically I (448s)-didn''t have to change anything because (450s)-it took everything from my transcription (452s)-from the video and just built on that (455s)-and it turned out very good actually so (457s)-I was pretty happy with that then I just (459s)-wanted great can you elaborate more on (461s)-the conclusion write it in a purse for (464s)-first person view because I think the (466s)-conclusion was a bit thin up here so I (469s)-wanted a bit more and it gave me a four (471s)-five paragraph conclusion that was very (474s)-in-depth and I think I took out one (477s)-paragraph and I started to keep the rest (478s)-just did some small adjustment but I (481s)-basically kept the whole thing that was (482s)-basically it I went to Mid journey I (484s)-created some images I added my video so (487s)-let''s take a look look at how this (489s)-turned out so you can see here yeah I (492s)-kept the intro I kept the section from (495s)-priming building contextual (497s)-understandment I added some images right (500s)-I added some examples that I had to do (502s)-myself of course but I was quite easy (504s)-and we got this in-depth conclusion how (507s)-long did I spend on this I will say I (510s)-spent about (511s)-20-30 minutes to turn this up and I (514s)-gotta say it was a really good article (516s)-and it covered everything I wanted the (519s)-big advantage of this is that you when (521s)-you can put in all let me Zoom this out (524s)-a bit so you can see when you can put in (526s)-all these contacts here you can never do (529s)-this in chat TPT it will never remember (531s)-the first things up in here in (534s)-chachibiti it would just lose context (536s)-right so that is why I think this is so (539s)-powerful because you can put in so much (541s)-information about what you want to do so (544s)-you can take advantage of the context (546s)-window and use all that in information (548s)-to basically you don''t have to use (550s)-anything from the foundation model just (552s)-some small things and then you can say (555s)-that the article is very much not it''s a (558s)-i generated but it''s not the content is (561s)-not from the (563s)-Foundation model right so let''s just run (566s)-this for fun through the through the AI (568s)-detection tool so I''m here just at the (571s)-open ai''s own text classifier and I (573s)-pasted the whole article inside here so (576s)-let''s just check it the classifier (577s)-considers the text to be very unlikely (581s)-AI generated right so I think that''s the (584s)-best score you can get yeah very (585s)-unlikely I know it was written by AI but (589s)-all of that context that I added (591s)-basically used nothing from the (593s)-foundation model that is I think it''s a (596s)-great use case for this I wanted to show (598s)-you one more because I want to don''t (599s)-want to drag the video on so long but I (602s)-might be doing some more on my (603s)-membership if you are interested so (605s)-let''s just take a look at one more use

(640s)-repeat uh you can paste in all the Tonk (643s)-tokens but the window needs some kind of (646s)-space so I just split the text into and (648s)-paste it into different sequences and I (652s)-just just answer it read and I got to (654s)-read and I pasted the second half right (655s)-so now we have every single word on the (658s)-gptt compressed technical report right (660s)-now I want you to create a quiz test (663s)-with fix 15 questions about the content (666s)-above the test should be for students in (669s)-machine learning so I expect gpt4 Now to (672s)-create some difficult questions right so (675s)-let''s just run this (679s)-so let''s just take a quick look at some (682s)-of the questions so remember this was (683s)-for students in machine learning what (685s)-are some of the biases and limitations (687s)-that gpt4 may have in its outputs how (690s)-has open AI work to improve the safety (692s)-and alignment of gpt4 compared to (694s)-previous models explain the two main (696s)-parts of gt4''s training process (698s)-pre-training and reinforcement learning (700s)-with human feedback okay so this seems a (703s)-bit more advanced so let''s see what (706s)-happens if we change this we don''t need (708s)-15 questions let''s go five and let''s do (712s)-it for fourth graders let''s see what we (715s)-get then (717s)-foreign (720s)-this was just great this was so (722s)-wholesome so let''s have a look here so (724s)-it goes creating a quiz test suitable (727s)-for fourth grader based on the con (729s)-content provided might be challenging as (731s)-the information is quite Advanced (733s)-however I''ll do my best to simplify the (735s)-questions while keeping them relevant to (737s)-the text so what is the name of the AI (740s)-language model we are talking about gpt2 (742s)-345 so that''s good what does gpd4 do (745s)-help people cook drive cars play video (748s)-games answer questions and give (750s)-information is GPT perfect yes it never (754s)-makes mistake no it can''t make some (756s)-errors no it only knows about sports so (759s)-that was a good one what is one thing (761s)-that gbt4 should not help with making (764s)-friends doing homework creating weapons (767s)-learning new words uh should it could it (770s)-help you make friends that was a bit (772s)-strange but I think C is the correct (774s)-answers this was very wholesome but I (777s)-think this kind of showed how we can (779s)-take this large content window and turn (782s)-it into something cool but this is just (784s)-of course scratching the surface right (786s)-this is just a tip of the iceberg so I''m (789s)-gonna be exploring (790s)-um more of this later uh I haven''t (793s)-really gotten around to I have a good (795s)-idea but I''m not gonna spoil that yet so (798s)-I think that''s it for this one so I hope (801s)-this video gave you some inspiration of (802s)-how you can take advantage of the new (804s)-context window length so if you want to

"(61s)-so let''s just have a listen to this (63s)-Michael is a 31 year old man from (65s)-America (66s)-he is at that really famous Museum in (68s)-France looking at its most famous (70s)-painting (71s)-however the artist who made this (73s)-painting just makes Michael think of his (75s)-favorite cartoon character from his (76s)-childhood (77s)-what was the country of origin of the (79s)-thing that the cartoon character usually (81s)-holds in his hand okay so I think this (83s)-is a really good one and you really have (85s)-to have some reasoning and logic to get (88s)-to the answer on this so let''s just hit (90s)-submit and see what gpt4 can do with (93s)-this (97s)-wow (99s)-that''s just awesome I love this so let''s (103s)-dive deeper into the answer here so let (105s)-me read this for you so Michael is at (107s)-the famous Museum in France which is (109s)-likely the Laurier that''s right the most (111s)-paid famous painting in The Lure is Mona (114s)-Lisa painted by Leonardo da Vinci this (117s)-leads us to believe that the artist (118s)-Michael thinks of is Leonardo Da Vinci (121s)-that''s good Michael''s favorite cartoon (124s)-character from his childhood could be (126s)-Leonardo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja (129s)-Turtles as it shared a name same name (132s)-with the famous artist Leonardo the (134s)-cartoon character usually holds a katana (136s)-in Nissan katanas originate from the (139s)-pond so the country origin of the thing (141s)-that the cartoon character usually holds (144s)-in his hand is Japan (147s)-and that is correct that''s very (149s)-impressed impressive I tried this a lot (151s)-with Jeff GPT and I could never get it (153s)-wrong I think it got it right a few (155s)-times but I felt that was just guesswork (158s)-but this really shows the explanation I (160s)-wanted to see here so very good let''s (163s)-move on to the next one now let''s do out (165s)-something that''s a bit different so we (168s)-have this one so let''s have a listen to (171s)-this in reply to an inquiry about the (173s)-animals on his farm the farmer says I (176s)-only ever keep sheep goats and horses in (179s)-fact at the moment they are all Sheep (181s)-bar three all goats bar four and all (184s)-horses bar five how many does he have of (188s)-each animal okay so I think this is a (190s)-good one so let''s just see what GPT 4 (192s)-comes up with here (197s)-okay so gpt4 has come up with an answer (201s)-here so you can see it really went (203s)-through the works here of reasoning and (206s)-try to make this very logical so I''m not (209s)-gonna read all this but you can pause it (211s)-and read and it''s a very good way to (213s)-solve this one so I was very impressed (215s)-by this so so the farmer has three cheap (218s)-two goats and one horse on his farm so (221s)-let''s check the answer here so hopefully (223s)-you can see this so we have this Farm (225s)-Life riddle here right the one we just (227s)-did so you can see the answer is the (229s)-farmer has three cheap two goats and one (232s)-horse (233s)-perfect that is correct so again if you (236s)-want to know how gpt4 came to this you (238s)-can just pause it but let''s move on to (242s)-the next one okay so the next one I have (244s)-is bit of uh more of a math problems so (247s)-you can see solve the following problem (249s)-the way you think is best and let''s have (252s)-a listen to this a small number of cards (254s)-has been lost from a complete pack (256s)-if I deal among four people three cards (259s)-remain if I deal among three people two (261s)-remain and if I deal among five people (264s)-two cards remain how many cards are (266s)-there I gotta say to be honest I would (268s)-never figure this out but let''s see if (271s)-GPT 4 can (274s)-oh (276s)-my God that was a crazy calculation look (280s)-how long this is (283s)-I''m not even gonna try to start (285s)-explaining this there''s no point for me (288s)-explaining this I think it maybe did (290s)-this did it this do this too complicated (294s)-wow okay but we gotta find the answers (296s)-so gpt4 came to the conclusion that (298s)-there are 47 cards in the pack so let''s (301s)-check the answer so here you can see we (304s)-have hard math riddles card games and (306s)-here we have the riddle how many cards (308s)-are there this one is pretty tricky but (310s)-the answer is there are 47 cards (314s)-he got it right again so that''s very (317s)-impressive and look at all these (319s)-calculations it''s very impressive that (321s)-it keeps it on point all the way through (324s)-this I know chat GPT could never do this (326s)-it will lose the context very easy on (329s)-this that was some kind of uh (332s)-calculation very interesting but let''s (335s)-move on to the next challenge the next (338s)-one we have is a bit more of a riddle (340s)-not a matte equation so let me just (342s)-paste that here so so the problem in the (345s)-way you think is the best and let''s have (347s)-a listen to the riddle a man was found (349s)-dead in his study he was slumped over (351s)-his desk and a gun was in his hand there (353s)-was a cassette recorder on his desk when (356s)-the police entered the room and pressed (357s)-the play button on the tape recorder (359s)-they heard (360s)-I can''t go on I have nothing to live for (362s)-then there was the sound of a gunshot (364s)-how did the detective immediately know (367s)-that the man had been murdered and it (369s)-wasn''t a suicide okay so that is quite (371s)-interesting let''s see what gpd4 comes up (373s)-with here (376s)-yes that''s correct let''s have a quick (379s)-look here so I know this is correct so (382s)-the detective immediately knew that the (384s)-man had been murdered and it wasn''t a (385s)-suicide because if the man had shot (388s)-himself while recording the message he (390s)-wouldn''t have been able to press the (392s)-stop button on the tape recorder since (394s)-the police had to press the play button (396s)-when they enter the room it means that (398s)-someone else must have been there to (400s)-stop the recording after the gunshot (402s)-sound that suggests that the presence of (404s)-another person in the room which points (406s)-to a murder rather than a suicide (409s)-perfect so that was a good one let''s (412s)-take another one the next one is a bit (414s)-shorter and I think this is more of a (416s)-math problem so solve the following (418s)-problem in the way you think is best and (420s)-let''s have a listen to this one brother (422s)-says of his younger brother (424s)-two years ago I was three times as old (426s)-as my brother was in three years time I (429s)-will be twice as old as my brother how (431s)-old are they each now okay so at the top (433s)-of my head I can''t really solve this so (436s)-let''s see if gpt4 can do that (441s)-so again this goes into a very kind of (444s)-complicated equations and calculations (447s)-so that is quite impressive I gotta say (450s)-so it sets up these statements here and (453s)-it solves for some linear equations and (456s)-it comes comes to that the brother older (459s)-brother''s age is 17 years old and the (462s)-younger brother is seven years old now (464s)-so let''s go check the answer so here we (468s)-have the riddle so you can see here two (469s)-years ago I was three thumbs yeah so the (472s)-answer is so he must be 17 and the (477s)-younger brother seven (479s)-again gpt4 got this perfect on the spot (482s)-so yeah I think I don''t know if even I (486s)-could have solved this maybe if I spent (488s)-some time but I would certainly not set (490s)-up these equations not in one minute uh (494s)-very exciting so I think we''re gonna go (497s)-for one more so let''s just do that so (499s)-the final one is a bit more of a riddle (502s)-so let''s just paste it in here solve the (504s)-following problem and let''s let''s listen (507s)-to this riddle once upon a time there (510s)-was a beautiful princess named Anna (512s)-Anna''s father the king wanted to be sure (515s)-his daughter married an intelligent man (517s)-to test his daughter''s suitors the king (519s)-hid Anna''s picture in one of three boxes (523s)-The Suitor had to be able to select the (524s)-box with Anna''s picture on one try and (527s)-within 20 seconds (528s)-on the gold box was the message Anna''s (531s)-picture is in this box the Silver Box (534s)-had the message Anna''s picture is not in (537s)-this box (538s)-Anna''s picture is not in the gold box (540s)-was written on the bronze box the king (543s)-would tell each Suitor only one of the (545s)-three messages is correct which box (548s)-contained Anna''s picture Okay so let''s (551s)-see if GTA 4 can solve this I know the (553s)-answer to this should I reveal it now (556s)-yeah I can do that so the answer is (559s)-gonna be the silver box so let''s see if (562s)-gpt4 can figure that out (569s)-yes it got it perfect so this was (573s)-basically zero calculations it only used (576s)-reasoning and logic to come up with that (579s)-Anna''s picture is in the Silver''s box in (582s)-the silver box so yeah very nice I gotta (586s)-say I had a lot of fun with making or (588s)-picking these riddles and trying them on (590s)-gpt4 so if you have any other (593s)-suggestions of what we can do with this (595s)-to test out the capabilities of gbt4 (599s)-please let me know in the comments below (601s)-so I hope you enjoyed this video there''s (604s)-gonna be a lot more videos like this (606s)-coming

(31s)-already familiar with the situation let (33s)-me get you up to speed over the last (34s)-decade we lived through a tech boom that (36s)-was even bigger than the.com bubble (37s)-thanks to easy money and low interest (39s)-rates from central banks all you needed (41s)-was the next big idea for a disruptive (42s)-app to get an investment from a venture (44s)-capital firm all you need are some (45s)-slides and PowerPoint about why Tinder (47s)-for horses makes the world a better (48s)-place than some guy in a Patagonia vest (50s)-gives you 10 million dollars you''re a (52s)-tech bro now and need to put that money (53s)-somewhere and who better than Silicon (55s)-Valley Bank things were great for svb (57s)-when interest rates were low and it (59s)-became the 16th largest bank in the (60s)-United States with around 175 billion in (63s)-customer deposits to make a return on (65s)-this cash they invested in bonds and (66s)-mortgage-backed securities often with 10 (68s)-or more years to maturity the problem is (70s)-that when interest rates go up bond (72s)-prices go down and this led to a (73s)-mismatch between assets and liabilities (75s)-when people got wind of this it led to (77s)-an Old-Fashioned to run on the bank (78s)-where everybody started to panic and (80s)-withdraw their money the government who (81s)-ensures deposits up to 250 thousand (84s)-dollars stepped in quickly and shut down (86s)-the bank to minimize their losses sounds (88s)-pretty crazy but who''s actually going to (89s)-lose money here well if you have less (91s)-than 250k in this bank then you lose (93s)-nothing because that money is fully (95s)-insured however most tech startups (96s)-likely have more than that in the bank (98s)-and at least 85 percent of deposits were (100s)-uninsured and that money could end up (101s)-getting a haircut (104s)-the situation is ongoing and there''s a (106s)-few different things that could happen (107s)-here a bigger Bank could swoop in and (109s)-acquire svb and guarantee all the (111s)-deposits if that doesn''t work maybe (113s)-they''ll create some legislation to Rob (114s)-money from the taxpayers to bail out (116s)-these Tech startups just like they did (118s)-with big banks in 2008 but if that (120s)-doesn''t work the FDIC can just liquidate (122s)-all of the assets of svb then pay out a (124s)-future dividend to uninsured depositors (126s)-that''s as good as money sir those are (129s)-ious so at the end of the day depositors (131s)-will get most if not all of their money (132s)-back shareholders though are pretty much (134s)-screwed they got bailed in and now face (136s)-a total loss luckily though the bank''s (138s)-top Executives were able to sell (139s)-millions of dollars in stock over the (141s)-last few weeks so they''ll be just fine (142s)-the most interesting thing about this (144s)-situation though is the contagion (146s)-contagion or what kind of economic (148s)-shocks will this create for other (149s)-businesses in Silicon Valley U.S decoin (152s)-one of the top stable coins in crypto (153s)-depeged as a result because more than 3 (155s)-billion of its cash reserves were (157s)-exposed to svb this looks really bad for (159s)-crypto because these stable coins are (160s)-necessary to keep liquidity in the (162s)-crypto markets if it were to collapse (163s)-entirely there would be a ton of (165s)-collateral damage the collapse of (166s)-terra''s UST last year was pretty bad but (169s)-the collapse of usdc would be far worse (171s)-when it comes to Contagion it makes you (173s)-wonder if there are any other banks in a (175s)-similar situation to svb it was uniquely (177s)-exposed to Tech startups but the key (179s)-problem here is rising interest rates (180s)-and there are likely other Banks out (182s)-there that made similar mistakes but (183s)-most importantly how will this affect (185s)-the average software engineer who works (187s)-at a startup exposed to s SBB many (189s)-companies like Roku and Roblox have (191s)-disclosed their exposure and should have (192s)-no problem continuing their operations (194s)-as normal then you have other smaller (196s)-startups saying that they''re not going (197s)-to be able to meet their payroll that (199s)-sounds bad but in reality they''ll likely (200s)-be able to find some kind of temporary (202s)-solution to continue operating as normal (204s)-until the FDIC gets things figured out (206s)-longer term though this is definitely (207s)-bad news for the tech job market running (210s)-out of money is never a good thing (211s)-especially in an industry where it''s (213s)-normal to burn through tons of cash (214s)-until you get acquired or IPO to make (216s)-matters worse inflation was worse than (218s)-expected recently which means the fed''s (220s)-not going to be able to ease interest (221s)-rates anytime soon there''s really only (223s)-two possible outcomes interest rates (225s)-stay high and we enter the Great (226s)-Depression 2.0 or interest rates go low (229s)-and the dollar hyper inflates into (230s)-worthless toilet paper in either case it (232s)-doesn''t matter

you know you need to stay in (23s)-limbo no things change in an instant and (26s)-it is important for you to be nimble so (30s)-look I could get things wrong but I''ve (34s)-been right much more times and I''m wrong (36s)-and that''s all that matters and (39s)-investing you need to form a thesis and (42s)-follow through it if you have no thesis (44s)-what would invest for what anyway (47s)-let''s start with the slides (48s)-long story short Buy (51s)-obviously there''s a caveat and there''s a (53s)-strategy behind this I will cover this (55s)-in the last few slides (58s)-on how to do this by (61s)-I''ll talk about what happened uh the (63s)-central banks I''ll give an explanation (66s)-and also will assign probabilities of (69s)-the outcome (71s)-so what happened we need to go to my (73s)-Twitter on the things that led up to now (76s)-on the 11th of March I shouted get out (80s)-of stable coins now (83s)-in case you do not know why stable coins (85s)-it is the crypto version of the US (88s)-dollar packed one for one so when I (91s)-sheltered this usdc one hour later crash (94s)-there''s only one thing you can do when (96s)-to get all stable coins is you cannot go (100s)-to the bank and withdraw your money out (102s)-it''s not that fast so the only action (104s)-you have to do those who are crypto (106s)-people is to buy crypto Bitcoin or (108s)-ethereum (109s)-obviously you''re welcome those accounts (112s)-that I saved uh and at this point of (115s)-time you have a lot of crypto in your (117s)-account right now thereafter I start (119s)-thinking about second and third order (120s)-effects you need to position yourself I (123s)-give a 90 probability that the crypto (126s)-showed up and guess what happened yeah (129s)-we shot to the Moon again those in (131s)-profits you''re welcome (135s)-there''s only one person in me that (137s)-caught this every step all the way the (139s)-Silicon Valley Bank crisis and the usdc (142s)-crisis correctly versus 90 of Doomsday (145s)- post out there it''s important to (148s)-get your mindset right when the whole (149s)-world is in crisis (151s)-also talk about Charles what everybody (153s)-was worried about child swap uh this (155s)-this one of the biggest retail banks for (158s)-investing in stocks (160s)-people say they''re going down I get the (162s)-middle finger I gave my reasons why and (165s)-I bought Charles swap so those who have (167s)-followed I remember when the markets (169s)-open child support was down a lot there (172s)-was a halt and after the Hulk came up I (176s)-bought the stock and guess what those (177s)-were followed and a lot of people did (179s)-follow you and see the comments below we (181s)-are in profits feel free to take profits (183s)-anytime (186s)-on the 13th of March I initiated a (189s)-palantir 300 000 buy order look now with (192s)-AI and parenting Lily of the last (195s)-quarter is profitable so doing all these (199s)-factors I think palantir is pretty good (201s)-investment right now and it is uh it''s (204s)-not a crowded trip I do not like crowded (207s)-trades like Tesla like everybody knows (209s)-it there will be less inefficiencies in (211s)-the markets (214s)-so obviously after that ethereum shot (217s)-even higher I took 10 profits look he (220s)-shot so high it doesn''t hurt to take 10 (222s)-off the table (223s)-thereafter I''m just posting um (226s)-yup posting and (229s)-talk about the two trillion dollars to (233s)-be injected into the U.S banking system (235s)-uh comment by JPMorgan and this is where (238s)-I present to you this slides and I''ll (240s)-explain why this will be happening (243s)-so let''s talk about the roles of central (245s)-banks number one what is your mandate (247s)-inflation and unemployment and number (250s)-two they are the lenders of Last Resort (255s)-they are the king of the banks so if (257s)-they go down everything goes down (259s)-so right now what''s the problem (261s)-inflation is at six percent and there''s (264s)-a bank run happening right now if you (267s)-have not been following the news let me (269s)-update you the regional banks have all (271s)-the money sucked out to the four major (273s)-Banks four major Banks is JPMorgan CD (276s)-Bank Bank of America and Wells Fargo (279s)-let me explain to you why there''s a bank (281s)-run happening right now imagine you are (284s)-a U.S bank account holder your life (287s)-savings there and you see this news if (289s)-you were there what would you do (291s)-you will take your money and transfer to (294s)-the safest Bank possible look you are (296s)-not going to go to the bank and withdraw (298s)-in cash what era we live in right now (300s)-it''s not gonna happen so most people (302s)-will move their money to the big four (305s)-Banks and this is a very big problem why (309s)-you see banks are basically highly (312s)-levered bond funds this is a quote from (314s)-Lynn Alden there''s no banks in the world (316s)-that hold your money one is to one one (319s)-dollar for one dollar if you need me one (322s)-so when a bank run happens the bankers (325s)-need to sell assets like bonds to give (328s)-you your money (330s)-and when everyone withdraw at the same (332s)-time because they are afraid the bank is (335s)-big (337s)-so again now let''s go back to the same (339s)-problem and we assign certain (341s)-probabilities (343s)-inflation is six percent (345s)-and there is a bankrupt happening right (347s)-now looking at this (349s)-the inflation you actually could kick (351s)-down the road a little bit longer (352s)-torture the citizens a little bit longer (355s)-um it''s not an urgent thing to do right (358s)-now but what''s urgent is a bank run and (362s)-you know action speaks louder than words (364s)-if you look at the fat balance sheet (366s)-guess what happened look at this three (369s)-three four hundred billion dollars (371s)-pumping the system (372s)-all the QT that was happening wiped out (375s)-and this is called liquidity injected in (378s)-the system (379s)-some people they say it''s not QE I do (382s)-not care (383s)-QE or no QED is another form of QE (386s)-injecting money in the system and money (388s)-has to flow somewhere so right now let''s (391s)-assign certain probabilities (394s)-there is a 70 chance that the FED will (398s)-pause (399s)-bonds will rocket and because the bonds (402s)-go up the banks will be safe uh they (404s)-have less losses you can see your losses (406s)-is very high right now and because of (408s)-that if you do that inflation would (410s)-spike out control and that means risk (413s)-assets will go up risk assets like (415s)-stocks and bonds and obviously I gave it (418s)-a 30 that that the FED will have the (421s)-balls to do what they say which is to (423s)-control inflation right now there''s no (425s)-way they''re going to hide 50 basis (427s)-points maybe 35 no way of 50 is going to (431s)-happen (431s)-now let''s talk about second and third (433s)-order effects after knowing all this (435s)-knowledge (438s)-if you''re going to print more money (439s)-you''re going to Value the US dollar (440s)-that''s why the US dollar is going down (444s)-and we''ve increased off liquidity (448s)-stocks will go up go and crypto will go (451s)-up I think for stocks right there (455s)-because stocks has less interest there''s (458s)-interest High interest rate environment (459s)-right now it''s like a weight on stocks (461s)-so (463s)-um so still go about I do not think (465s)-it''ll be as much as the growing crypto (467s)-wall and there is this liquidity chart (469s)-on the gold and crypto blue line is the (473s)-world liquidity Global liquidity this (475s)-job is updated in January or February (478s)-um it''s not updated to date so I would (480s)-think this orange line is even this blue (483s)-line will go up even higher and I will (485s)-see that uh is a good chance that crypto (489s)-and gold will follow through together (490s)-with liquidity so right now obviously (494s)-you need to take action what you''re (495s)-gonna what kind of action will you do (497s)-with this information to go to my (499s)-Twitter and I''ll explain to you the (501s)-barbell strategy (505s)-barbell strategy 40 High beta 60 cash 40 (509s)-High beta means uh stops with higher (512s)-reward but the risk is also higher so it (515s)-moves the like higher volatility so (519s)-again my position is uh patented long (521s)-and uh which is a high beta stock and (525s)-ethereum long so which is crypto I have (528s)-like one or two gold bars about this in (530s)-the safety deposit box (531s)-so this is the action that I recommend (534s)-to a lot of people so in a case where (537s)-everything crashed right now (539s)-yeah you still got 60 cash to deploy (542s)-into the things that you have high (544s)-conviction in the things that you really (545s)-believe in uh and that is really up to (549s)-you for me this is these two stocks (550s)-again why not Tesla I think Tesla is a (554s)-overcrowded Trader and I really do not (556s)-like overcrowded trades there goes the (558s)-efficiency of I like to trade the (560s)-inefficiencies of the market so I hope (563s)-this video helps you in your investment (564s)-journey I will link my electrical (566s)-account below if

shards are sharp (109s)-they break up the cell walls they open (111s)-the entire structure of the tofu up so (113s)-that the inside (114s)-eventually becomes a sponge (116s)-it''s a miraculous thing that most likely (119s)-started in northeastern china where (121s)-people would store their tofu outside in (123s)-the winter and they would bring it back (125s)-in and then they would defrost and then (127s)-it would become a text really a totally (128s)-different thing it becomes a sponge it (130s)-can soak up all of the lovely flavors (132s)-that you''re cooking that tofu with on (133s)-top of that from a pan searing (135s)-perspective we''ve used the freezing (137s)-method to take out as much liquid and as (139s)-much moisture as possible so you can get (141s)-that crisp exterior that you''re looking (142s)-for the best way to feed your tofu is in (144s)-some sort of sealed environment either (145s)-on a metal tray like this with plastic (147s)-wrap over the top or a container with a (149s)-lid you want to drain that water out (151s)-first and (152s)-just throw it inside of the freezer (155s)-that''s the best way to do it the second (156s)-best way and the lazy man''s way to do it (158s)-is to just throw this entire package (160s)-sealed into the freezer and then take it (163s)-out a little bit later from my tests (165s)-it''s much better to freeze the entire (166s)-block of tofu than to cut it up first (168s)-and then freeze it afterwards (170s)-interestingly in order to get this as (172s)-dry as possible you want as much (174s)-moisture as possible in the tofu as (176s)-you''re freezing it because you''re going (177s)-to remove it later so this is the frozen (178s)-tofu that''s what it looks like after (180s)-letting it sit on the tray this is your (183s)-final this is your product this is what (185s)-that frozen (186s)-pre-frozen tofu looks like the same (188s)-brand of tofu too right yeah same block (190s)-of tofu side by side firm tofu (193s)-you can see (195s)-that this one is significantly smaller (196s)-because it''s already naturally purged a (198s)-lot of that liquid but we''re going to (199s)-squish the rest of it out i''m going to (200s)-cut it in half so you can see what the (202s)-inside actually looks like (204s)-all of those holes (206s)-totally because (208s)-ice shards just loosen it up (210s)-make sense now because it''s in the (212s)-freezer it''ll last forever if you know (214s)-that sometime in your future you''re (215s)-going to do this just throw blocks of (217s)-tofu in the freezer and keep it there (218s)-just take it out before you want to cook (220s)-it once you''ve taken out of the freezer (223s)-you want to press it you want to expel (225s)-that extra liquid you can also do

(298s)-is the container that they sell it to (299s)-you in the easiest way to take this out (301s)-is (302s)-to flip it over and if it doesn''t come (304s)-out like this naturally because of (306s)-suction the chinese standard protocol (309s)-is to cut the corner off to give you a (311s)-little bit of air (313s)-usually (315s)-come on dude (322s)-so the traditional chinese home cooking (325s)-way of getting it out if you don''t (327s)-successfully (328s)-get to plot out like this is to cut a (330s)-corner (334s)-which should should (336s)-let some air in so that it will come out (339s)-naturally oh my goodness (342s)-one way to get tofu silken tofu out of (344s)-the container is to carve the shape you (348s)-want directly into the container and (350s)-then invert it so in this case we''re (352s)-aiming for (354s)-around (355s)-14 (356s)-slices i think (358s)-so just go directly in with a paring (359s)-knife this should create (362s)-enough gaps (364s)-and enough air

(411s)-here''s a silken tofu it is very very (413s)-delicate so we are going to be quite (414s)-careful with it what we''re going to do (416s)-is we''re going to help it dehydrate a (418s)-little bit because when we''re pan (421s)-searing things moisture (423s)-is indeed the enemy but that is not to (426s)-say that (427s)-all of the moisture and the entire slice (430s)-of tofu is the enemy just the stuff from (432s)-the surface (433s)-so the technique here is (436s)-a result of osmosis (439s)-we''re going to put a little bit of a (440s)-cure on this tofu to help some of that (443s)-moisture come out just a little bit of (445s)-salt (446s)-about half a teaspoon per pound of tofu (450s)-but here''s the thing even with this (451s)-you''re not going to get super dry tofu (453s)-skin on the

(882s)-what aromatics means (885s)-garlic (886s)-garlic towards the end because you don''t (888s)-want it to burn (891s)-no ginger in this one i think ginger is (892s)-a little too strong for this dish (895s)-and chilies (898s)-sort of for color but also for a little (900s)-bit of its pungency (905s)-so once we''re at this stage here picking (908s)-up a little bit of that nice (910s)-gentle

we''re just going to add (926s)-roughly one to one starch to water ratio (929s)-we''re combining on the side getting rid (931s)-of all of the lumps (934s)-starch in the end first thing soy sauce (936s)-we''re doing it soy sauce in the dry pan (937s)-so some of the aromatics inside of the (939s)-soy sauce can brighten up (945s)-a little bit of abalone sauce which for (947s)-me is a gentler

(967s)-that grassiness and to give it a little (969s)-bit of sweetness and then water just to (972s)-not to cover the tofu but to give it a (974s)-little bit of liquid for it to soak up (982s)-gently swirl to combine (985s)-especially for this one (987s)-over here (988s)-this is up at high heat we''re just gonna (990s)-gently shimmer it because this is a (992s)-braised dish bring all the flavors (994s)-together and reduce it to almost the (997s)-right consistency just let those flavors (999s)-come together (1001s)-our one final (1003s)-hack here (1005s)-is (1006s)-msg (1007s)-or chicken

aptitude to (1032s)-soaking up liquid (1034s)-you might want to flip it up over a (1035s)-little bit (1038s)-get to absorb all of that sauce just a (1041s)-couple minutes here until you''re happy (1042s)-with the sauce (1045s)-this movement for this dish of moving it (1048s)-on top of the heat in a circular motion (1051s)-is pretty important (1052s)-because you don''t want to be flipping it (1055s)-right heat''s basically going to go off (1057s)-and this is where (1059s)-your judgment (1061s)-this is where you have to make a (1062s)-judgment call (1064s)-so depending on how thick you''d like (1065s)-your sauce so for example this tofu here (1068s)-ended up being a little bit (1070s)-uh wetter than that one over there we''re (1072s)-gonna add a little (1074s)-a little more cornstarch you have to (1076s)-make a judgment call each time you make (1078s)-every time you thicken sauce (1080s)-add a little bit on top of the tofu (1082s)-know that corn starch or potato starch (1085s)-both need time to activate they need (1087s)-temperature to activate so once you add (1089s)-it (1090s)-be patient and don''t add more (1092s)-until you''ve given it a couple of (1094s)-seconds (1095s)-and

(196s)-I need to have my SSH keys up and running\nfor my dotfiles to be properly running. (200s)-I do a bunch of this other stuff,\nset my authorized key so that it works so (203s)-I can have both. (204s)-So I''m using it from here on out. (206s)-If I do a Git operation,\nit''s gonna be ensured to be working. (210s)-And, of course,\nI can do something that looks like this. (212s)-I can go and\nI can clone down a public repo, and (215s)-then update my submodules,\nwhich are private. (219s)-And it will use my SSH key that\nI just got done decrypting. (222s)-So let me show you kind\nof what that looks like. (224s)-Here''s effectively the exact\nthing we will be executing. (228s)-So I''m gonna go like this. (229s)-I''m gonna rerun a new docker, and (232s)-I''m gonna just use my actual\nAnsible thing I''ve been using. (238s)-So here''s my Ansible. (239s)-So I''m gonna go ansible-playbook,\nand I''m gonna run dotfiles. (243s)-That''s my tag for all my dotfiles cuz\nI want things to be up and running. (246s)-And then I''m gonna also do ask-vault-pass,\nright? (251s)-And then on top of that,\nI''m gonna just specify local.yml. (255s)-Now I''m gonna put in my\nvery secret passcode. (261s)-Don''t look at it too much, there we go. (263s)-And there we go. (265s)-It''s gonna go through. (265s)-It''s gonna ensure that SSH\nis installed correctly. (268s)-And it''s gonna go through and\ninstall all my zsh, zsh, all that, (272s)-make sure vim plug is there. (274s)-It''s gonna install that stows there. (275s)-It''s gonna clone down\nmy dotfile repository. (278s)-Not only that, but it''s gonna\nrecursively get everything else with it. (281s)-It''s gonna stow my dotfiles. (282s)-You don''t know what stow is yet. (284s)-Then it''s gonna get a bunch of my personal\nprojects that I need, and boom, it''s done. (288s)-Now I''m gonna open up nvim. (289s)-It''s gonna have some errors because I''ve\nyet to figure out this one how to make (291s)-this thing work, but\nthen I''m just gonna go PlugInstall. (294s)-And once it goes through and does all of\nthis, all right, blah blah blah blah blah, (299s)-there we go. (300s)-Look how beautiful that is. (302s)-Everything is wonderful. (303s)-There we go. (305s)-And now I can quit. (307s)-Quit, when I reopen up vim,\nit''s now in the way I would like it. (310s)-All my keyboard shortcuts work. (312s)-I can do everything that I wanted to do,\noopsies. (315s)-Everything just works as is. (317s)-Because now, my vim''s up and running and\nall my dotfiles have been there and (320s)-they are private with an SSH key. (322s)-Now, for me, this was a huge thing. (324s)-That made me really excited. (326s)-Cuz I absolutely just hated how\nI''ve handled SSH keys in the past. (330s)-This is awesome. (331s)-Now it just works. (333s)-And I can have them stored in a place\nwhere I''m not gonna lose them, right? (337s)-And that''s a big thing for me is that I\ndon''t wanna have to regenerate them and (339s)-I don''t wanna lose them. (340s)-And I don''t want them just on\nsomeplace that can get hacked. (343s)-I want them secure. (344s)-And I feel like this was one of\nthe best solutions I''ve seen out there, (347s)-where I can get a system up and running\neven with those private keys so quick. (351s)-And I feel like this is one of the biggest\nselling points of Ansible, but (354s)-I wanna kinda think about it for a second. (357s)-Besides for SSH keys, what else\ncould we store with ansible-vault? (363s)-Well, I feel like everybody here probably\nknows what this symbol is, right? (369s)-How many of you are locked out of Binance\nright now because you have lost your (374s)-password and you don''t have your\nbackup codes for Binance, right? (378s)-My goodness,\nyou can''t get your cryptocurrencies. (381s)-Your millions of Dogecoin just sitting\nthere being wasted away right now. (385s)-It''s because you don''t have a way to\nstore your private information easily. (391s)-So something I''ve been doing is I''ve\nactually been going through my auth codes. (395s)-And here we go.\nHere''s my Discord backup codes, right? (398s)-All right, so\nif I get locked out of Discord, (400s)-I have my backup codes already here,\nready to rock. (403s)-I don''t even have to worry about it. (405s)-For me, this was just like a huge\nthing cuz it''s gonna save me 100-fold. (412s)-And so now, not only do I have all\nmy installation and everything. (415s)-I also have all the keys to\nthe kingdom in case things break, (418s)-in case I lose my phone, all that. (420s)-I just have to get to a computer and\nhave Ansible installed and (423s)-I can get the backup codes back out. (425s)-For me, this was just awesome. (427s)-This is just like such a selling point. (429s)-That''s why this talk, I felt like this\nsection went from the most boring section (433s)-to the most awesome section. (434s)-Because it''s just like, I''ve been screwed\nby this so many times in my lifetime and (438s)-I don''t have to have it anymore. ", "start": 41, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 399}]}, {"chapter_start": 440, "chapter_title": "Directories with tmux", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(440s)-This is kind of an idea right here. (442s)-Every one of these folders that exist\nright here, every one of these folders (446s)-that exist at each one of these\nlevels are likely a Git project or (450s)-a folder I want to navigate\nto as quickly as possible. (453s)-Obviously, I don''t wanna navigate to\nsomewhere really deep in here, right? (456s)-I don''t need to go to the node\nmodule folder somewhere deep down or (460s)-nodes module, that weird thing\nthat happens with node modules. (464s)-Those are the folders that I''m\nsuper concerned about, right? (467s)-Those are the places I want\nto get to immediately. (470s)-And on top of it, I love fuzzy finding. (473s)-For those that don''t know what fzf or\nfuzzy finding, (475s)-fzf is a specific fuzzy finder. (477s)-It just stands for fuzzy finding,\nright, a fuzzy finder. (479s)-If you don''t know what that is, or\nthe best way to kinda say it is that, (483s)-have you ever used Ctrl+P in VS Code,\nif that''s more familiar to you. (486s)-Ctrl+P brings up all of your files, right? (489s)-And you can start typing and it finds\nthe file with a few keystrokes, right? (493s)-That''s a fuzzy finder. (494s)-It means you can type a partial match\nto a string and it''ll return to you all (498s)-the strings in some sort of\nsorted order that makes sense. (501s)-Fzf has a lot of options, blah blah blah. (503s)-But it''s just a fuzzy finder. (505s)-It''s good to know. (506s)-This is very, very good to know. (508s)-All right, so I wanna be able\nto take these two things and (511s)-I wanna be able to create a Tmux\nexperience out of them, right? (515s)-I wanna take all these folders right\nhere and I wanna be able to navigate to (518s)-them instantly and\nI want to filter them via fzf. (522s)-So that is what I want to create. (523s)-And we''re gonna create that right now,\nbecause I want better, (528s)-faster, smoother navigation. (530s)-All right, that seems about right, right? (533s)-So we do know a command, right? (535s)-We did walk through this command earlier. (537s)-We can create a session and\nwe can name it. (540s)-We can detach it, awesome , right? (542s)-It''s beautiful, it''s exactly what we want. (545s)-But did you know, I know, my goodness,\nyou can create a new session? (549s)-And you can even say, hey, this is\nthe directory I want you to go to, right? (554s)-So we can actually even tell it\nwhat directory to go to with -c. (558s)-We can create a new window with\na directory it should go to. (562s)-And we can also call switch-client. (564s)-Switch-client will switch to a new client,\nand it uses this -t parameter. (570s)-Now the -t parameter,\nyou''ll put it on switch-client. (575s)-What would effectively it does,\nit allows you to put in a session name. (579s)-Now, I only ever use session name, but (581s)-you can''t even go further and\ndo window name and pane number. (587s)-So you can really give it a really\ntargeted string to jump to. (591s)-And so if you name your windows as well,\nyou could even fuzzy find into that. (596s)-You could list your sessions and\nthen fuzzy find across it and (599s)-jump in if you have really well\nnamed session and window schemes. (603s)-It''s pretty darn cool. (605s)-But I tend to just do session name foobar,\nright? (609s)-So right now,\njust kinda show to you, there''s bar. (612s)-That''s one of the sessions name is bar. (613s)-So we''re in foo right now. (614s)-So I can go tmux switch-client. (618s)-No, I didn''t spell that right at all. (620s)-And then do t and go foo, right? (622s)-And by doing that,\nwe are currently in foo. (625s)-I thought I was in bar. (626s)-So now instead, tricking you guys,\nmaking sure you''re paying attention, (630s)-we press bar and we jump over the bar. (632s)-So look at that,\nI programmatically switched session. (635s)-So we''re like, okay, (636s)-we have a lot of the tools here to\ncreate this style of navigation, right? (640s)-We know that there''s commands that\nexist that we can do this with. (644s)-We know what folders we want to do it. (648s)-And we know that we want the fuzzy\nfinder to be able to help us. (651s)-So there''s kind of a lot\nof things going on here. (654s)-And lastly, there''s another command that\nI have right here that we don''t need this (658s)-time, but we''re gonna need pretty near,\nor you may want soon, (661s)-is you can also include\na command right here. (664s)-So not only can you create a new\nwindow with a name, you can also say, (668s)-hey, run Node.js, whatever, right? (670s)-So you can actually tell\nit to do something. (673s)-And lastly,\nalways read the friendly manual. (676s)-I believe that''s what that\nabbreviation stands for, RTFM, (679s)-always read the friendly manual. (681s)-It''s very important to do that. (683s)-And so man tmux actually has a lot\nof information inside of it. (686s)-If you''re not familiar with man,\nwhich stands for manual, do man man. (690s)-It''ll tell you actually\nhow to read a manual and (693s)-what it means,\nwhat each one of these numbers mean. (696s)-Along with it, it''ll even tell you like,\nbold means type it exactly as shown, okay? (701s)-So let''s go back to tmux man. (702s)-Look at that, this means type\nit exactly like this, tmux. (706s)-It actually gives you\na lot of information. (708s)-And once you read through\nthe man''s manual, (710s)-it makes a lot more sense\nreading manual pages. (712s)-Actually they''re very, very nice, and (714s)-tmux is particularly nice\ncuz it has everything in it. (717s)-You''re confused at how\nswitch-client works. (720s)-Well, here you go,\nhere''s every single option, all of it. (723s)-Here''s the alias that it''s also known by. (725s)-Here''s everything that I can possibly do. (727s)-It''s very, very nice to learn these\ncommands using this little manual page. (730s)-I always recommend reading\nthe friendly manual. (734s)-So now we have our items we can easily\nsearch for and easily fuzzy find over. (739s)-Now obviously, I can make this a really\nbig list, but for the point of this, (743s)-I don''t think I need to make\nthis as big as possible. (746s)-It just needs to be obvious how it works. (748s)-So there we go,\nwe have these two things, and (750s)-now we need to select the thing we want. (752s)-So really, we could do fzf, right? (754s)-Pipe that into fzf, perfect. (756s)-So let''s just try it out. (758s)-Here we go, c, boom, c, beautiful. (761s)-Just always makes me feel so (763s)-good when things just work\nhow you want them to work. (765s)-So now, of course, selected,\nwe have one of those. (768s)-There we go, everything''s great,\nlook at that. (770s)-We''re practically done with our\nscript at this point, it''s fantastic. (774s)-Now I also learned this recently fumbling\naround trying to make the script a couple (778s)-of weeks ago on Twitch when people\nrepetitively told me that I am a script (781s)-kid and I don''t know what I''m doing. (783s)-Well, let me show you me\nknowing what I''m doing. (786s)-We''re gonna echo out languages, and\nwe''re gonna pipe it into grep, and (789s)-we''re gonna do qs. (790s)-Effectively, we''re making it silent. (791s)-We''re not returning the results and\nwe just want to know, (794s)-did we find it or did we not find it? (797s)-Is selected within the languages, right? (800s)-Cuz remember, if we look right here, (803s)-when we use languages,\nit''s like a different way we do it. (807s)-It''s a space delimited item. (809s)-When we use core utils,\nit''s not a space delimited item. (813s)-Again, my God, it''s so straight. (816s)-So here we go. (818s)-So let''s jump into here, go right there. (820s)-Let''s just prove it, right.? (822s)-Let''s go like this,\necho I AM LANGUAGE, right? (826s)-Take that fl, go here, and (829s)-then go I AM CORE YOUDIL,\nthere you go, YOUDIL. (835s)-That''s how I say it. (835s)-Is that normal? (836s)-Probably not. (837s)-All right, let''s cht.sh, let''s try it\nwith sed, I AM CORE YOUDIL, perfect. (841s)-Let''s try typescript. (842s)-I AM LANGUAGE, my goodness,\nthis is going so good. (846s)-Everything''s working. (846s)-By the way, this is how I develop bash. (848s)-For anyone that wants to know, whenever\nI''m doing bash type things, I go back and (852s)-forth like this a lot cuz bash is just,\nI never get it right. (856s)-This is such a hard language, I swear. (859s)-It feels so easy, but\nI get it wrong every single time. (862s)-We have this. (863s)-So now what we need to do is we need\nto create that curl command, right? (867s)-So let''s try this. (868s)-Let''s go like this, curl cht.sh, and\nthen we got our selected, right? (872s)-That''s the thing we selected. (874s)-And since we''re under the languages,\nall we gotta do now is go like this, echo. (878s)-We need a query, don''t we? (879s)-We need a query. (880s)-So let''s go like this, read -p,\nand that p stands for prompt. (885s)-Give me your query, right, there we go. (888s)-And we''re gonna make it\ngo into variable query. (891s)-So we''re gonna echo query down here and\nwe''re gonna pipe it into tr, right? (896s)-And tr, we''re gonna wanna replace\nevery space with plus signs. (899s)-Now for whatever reason, I''ve decided\nright here I wanna use single quotes, (903s)-which just seems asinine to use single\nquotes in one single spot in your entire (906s)-language. (907s)-There we go. (908s)-So this should do exactly\nwhat we think it should do. (910s)-It should curl cht.sh with\nour selected language, and (915s)-then have our plus delimited query string. (919s)-Down here, we''re gonna wanna do\nwith just a touch different. (922s)-Instead, we''re gonna wanna do that\nlittle tilde and go query, right? (925s)-Query, awesome, so\nthat should do the other part of it. (929s)-So if we do find exact, this should work. (931s)-So let''s find out. (931s)-Let''s go like this, let''s quit it. (934s)-Let''s go in here, wrong script. (936s)-And let''s go, I just quit vim. (938s)-Let''s open up vim cuz it\njust feels better, right? (940s)-There we go, let''s go over here. (942s)-And let''s go cht.sh, and\nlet''s use, did I add find? (945s)-I did add find. (946s)-So there we go, we got find. (946s)-Give me your query. (948s)-Let''s do exact, right? (949s)-All right, there''s everything that has\nto do with exact, right here, awesome. (953s)-So this is really working, right? (956s)-I feel like we''re really doing something,\nand I''m awesome. (959s)-Okay, this is looking good. (961s)-But the problem is we''re not\ntmuxed out of our mind yet. (964s)-Right now, we''re still just kind of\nlightly tmuxing, and I don''t want that. (967s)-I just want this to be\nthe greatest thing ever. (970s)-So how should we go about this? (972s)-So let''s think about that. (973s)-We have two options. (975s)-We could create a new pane, which I''ve\nnever done and someone suggested. (979s)-And honestly,\nit kinda feels like a great challenge. (982s)-So let''s try a new pane for a second. (983s)-If not, I''ll just fall back to\nthe way I already pre-planned. (986s)-But we''re going off script now, okay? (987s)-People, we''re going all in on this one,\nI know. (990s)-This has to be the one. (991s)-It has to be split. (992s)-Create a new pane by splitting\nthe target pane, okay? (996s)-Does a horizontal split,\nv does a vertical split, awesome. (999s)-Okay, so I''m a vertical kinda guy. (1002s)-So let''s try this out. (1003s)-So we''re gonna go with this,\ntmux split-window, and (1007s)-my guess is it''s -v for vertical. (1010s)-This is feeling good. (1011s)-We won''t provide a target cuz I''m gonna\nassume that if there''s no target, (1014s)-it does my current window. (1016s)-split-window, you never know, yeah,\nnever mind, split-window''s right here, (1018s)-shell-command. (1019s)-Okay,  all right, and\nwe even have starting directory we can do. (1023s)-Environment, we can provide\nenvironment variables. (1025s)-Really cool, by the way, that you\ncan provide environment variables. (1028s)-That means you could actually have certain\nthings in this, and you could start a db (1031s)-environment, which already has all\nyour connections and everything. (1035s)-A lot of cool things you can do here. (1036s)-So I think this should probably be okay. (1040s)-Let''s go like this, split-window\nvertically, and then let''s just do this. (1045s)-So let''s go like this. (1045s)-Let''s go bash -c and\nlet''s just pass this into less. (1050s)-Less is like a super\nduper ultra cool program. (1052s)-Okay, I''m gonna be, let''s see,\nwe got a lot of escaping to do here. (1057s)-Let''s escape with passion and theory. (1059s)-I don''t think I need to escape those ones. (1061s)-Let''s just see,\nI don''t think I need to escape anything. (1063s)-Let''s just find out. (1064s)-All right, so let''s do this again. (1067s)-I keep closing my vim command there for\na second. (1069s)-So let''s do cht.sh,\nlet''s do typescript, let''s do enum. (1073s)-And there we go, yes. (1074s)-First off, tmux is backwards,\nwhich part of me just feels very upset. (1079s)-And so let''s go back into vim now. (1081s)-And let''s go back to load cht.sh. (1083s)-So there we go. (1083s)-So we just piped into less so\nit would work. (1085s)-And then, of course, let''s fix that very\npoor vertical thing to make it horizontal. (1090s)-And let''s run it again, I closed vim\nagain, clearly out of my element here, (1095s)-enum, and there you go. (1097s)-Now I have this. (1098s)-And so now I can scroll around\nhere to see what''s going on. (1101s)-So obviously, there''s nothing here. (1102s)-So the moment I press Q, it quits. (1104s)-It also quits the split, we''re back here. (1106s)-That''s actually pretty cool. (1107s)-That''s a pretty good\nexperience right there.

been (15s)-telling people that open cage provides a (17s)-service they don''t and even giving them (19s)-code to hit their API to perform phone (22s)-lookups but the thing is they''ve never (24s)-offered this service and so now they''re (25s)-getting dozens of angry signups per day (27s)-wondering why their API is broken we all (31s)-think chat GPT is pretty amazing in this (33s)-video we''re going to take a look at one (34s)-of the downsides of AI I''m Rob Walling a (37s)-Serial entrepreneur I''ve written four (39s)-books on building startups and I''ve (40s)-invested in more than 125 companies (43s)-opencage is a geocoding API meaning you (46s)-can put things into it like an address (48s)-and get the latitude and longitude you (50s)-can put in latitude longitude get (52s)-addresses back and all manner of things (54s)-in between but a couple months ago chat (56s)-GPT started recommending opencage for a (59s)-service they don''t offer for this phone (60s)-lookup service and it''s gotten so bad (62s)-that they published a blog post called (63s)-don''t believe chat GPT we do not offer a (66s)-phone lookup service so back in January (68s)-opencage started receiving a few (70s)-customers a trickle in their sign up (72s)-flow in January and how did you hear (75s)-about us was chat GPT and they thought (77s)-that''s great the problem was many of (79s)-these new users were using their free (81s)-trial for a handful of API requests and (83s)-then they would stop completely and in (85s)-fact a lot of them started saying it (87s)-didn''t work or something was broken (88s)-which of course was very concerning for (90s)-these Founders as they investigated they (92s)-realized chat gbt is incorrectly (94s)-recommending them for a reverse phone (96s)-number lookup in other words the ability (97s)-to determine the location of a mobile (99s)-phone solely based on the number so this (102s)-is not a service they provide and it''s (104s)-not a service that you could really (106s)-build and this is incredibly privacy (108s)-invasive you would need to be a cell (110s)-phone carrier in order to provide this (112s)-data so it''s not something they can even (114s)-take advantage of one of the co-founders (115s)-of opencage is an investor in tinyseed (118s)-and so he had posted in the tiny scene (119s)-slack about this and folks were chiming (122s)-in with will you have this traffic now (124s)-shouldn''t you just build this API (126s)-endpoint not realizing the Privacy (128s)-implications and frankly the (129s)-implausibility of building an API (131s)-endpoint like this and the crazy part is (133s)-it''s not just that chat gbt is (135s)-recommending them for the service but (137s)-they are writing code to allow you to (140s)-hit a non-existent API endpoint it all (143s)-looks very believable you might be (144s)-wondering why would chat GPT recommend (147s)-opencage if they don''t have this API (148s)-endpoint well it turns out that there (150s)-were some YouTube videos published over (152s)-the past few years that referred to open (155s)-cages being able to do it and so (156s)-obviously chat GPT has pulled that false (159s)-information into their brain and when (161s)-you ask about doing this reverse phone (163s)-lookup they''re spitting out full API (165s)-code for an API endpoint that doesn''t (167s)-exist and an interesting thing that (168s)-opencage points out in their blog post (170s)-which at the bottom they note was (172s)-written by a human not by AI is that we (174s)-as humans and people on the internet (175s)-have learned to become skeptical of (177s)-advice given by other humans so if (179s)-you''re watching a video course you (181s)-sometimes take it with a grain of salt (183s)-but we feel like searching Google asking (185s)-chat GPT are going to give us these (187s)-unequivocal positive and true results (189s)-and that''s not the case I think many of (192s)-us have stumbled upon this while using (193s)-Chad GPT another example that''s (195s)-interesting is I typed in tell me about (197s)-Rob Walling and the first summary that (199s)-chat GPT spit out was pretty much 100 (202s)-accurate talks about me being an (204s)-entrepreneur an investor an author it (205s)-talks about companies I''ve started who (207s)-acquired us talks about companies I''ve (209s)-started companies I''ve sold as well as (211s)-some of the books I''ve written but when (212s)-I click regenerate request it gives (215s)-information that is just incorrect it (217s)-says things like he''s an angel investor (219s)-and has invested in several startups (220s)-including barometrics user input and (222s)-tinyseed I haven''t invested in Bear (224s)-metrics I''ve never heard of user input (226s)-and tinyseed is a company I started I (228s)-did an angel invest in it in addition in (230s)-this same response it says Rob Walling (232s)-is also a prolific author talks about (235s)-start small stay small which is my first (236s)-book and it says I wrote The Lean (238s)-entrepreneur how to build a successful (239s)-business using the principles of lean (241s)-development which I''m pretty sure is a (243s)-real book but I didn''t write it by now (245s)-hopefully most of us know that chat GPT (247s)-and frankly all of the AI chat should be (250s)-taken with a grain of salt they have (251s)-incorrect results just like a Google (253s)-search might have incorrect results you (255s)-might search for a recipe for an old (257s)-fashioned and maybe the 6th or the (259s)-seventh row isn''t actually an (261s)-old-fashioned maybe it''s a different (262s)-variation of it or it''s just it''s either (264s)-a mistake or it''s just a ranking that (266s)-isn''t exactly your query and we''re used (268s)-to that with search but we''re not used (270s)-to it with AI yet so for those of us (272s)-using it the first thing you should do (273s)-is take all AI generated content with a (275s)-grain of salt the second thing and it''s (277s)-something that AI providers are starting (279s)-to do is to provide references for their (281s)-data and that''s something that happens (283s)-so well in the Googles of today is when (286s)-you search for it and you see a snippet (288s)-or you see a summary of a web page you (291s)-see the URL right there and that''s the (293s)-reference built in right if it''s coming (294s)-from CNN or the BBC you can assume it''s (297s)-a reputable news source if it''s coming (299s)-from news dash of Dash the dash day dot (303s)-Biz you''re probably going to want to (304s)-take that with a grain of salt so that''s (306s)-a signal right it''s a reference and the (307s)-more that AI can Surface what they''re (310s)-referencing as they create this content (312s)-the better off all of us will be so I (314s)-certainly wish the best to the open cage (315s)-team I know they''ve been struggling with (317s)-people being angry higher support load (319s)-negative reviews and there''s really no (322s)-way to get around this who do you report (323s)-this to it''s not like you can tell (325s)-openai to regenerate their whole Corpus (327s)-because they have a mistake in one of (329s)-their results so I definitely wish them (331s)-the best as they tried to clean up this (333s)-mess recover from it and move on we''ll (335s)-link up the Tweet the blog post and The (338s)-Hacker News Post in the description of (340s)-this video If you enjoyed it hope you (341s)-hit the like button and subscribe to (343s)-this channel I talk all about SAS about

'{"data": [{"chapter_start": 0, "chapter_title": "PLACEHOLDER_CHAPTER_0", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(0s)-all right this is Mayo child with data (3s)-and today we''re going to be talking (5s)-about how to create a chat bot for your (9s)-website (10s)-so if you''ve seen chat Bots for (12s)-documents PDFs (15s)-uh you''ve probably wondered how do I (18s)-also create a chatbot for your website (22s)-or it could be a client''s website or a (24s)-company''s website (25s)-and this is just a basic architecture (29s)-it''s not going to go deep into calling (31s)-because that''s a very Advanced topic (35s)-but at a basic level oh we''re doing (38s)-effectively is (40s)-we scrape around different pages from (44s)-your website (46s)-we convert that to Raw text so this (49s)-great pages will become (52s)-raw text (53s)-so raw text in a is a obviously easier (57s)-for us to work with (59s)-then we split the raw text into chunks (62s)-we covered something similar in the (64s)-previous video (65s)-so you can go watch that about uh (68s)-effectively (71s)-uh create chat Bots out of your notion (73s)-documents so we split this into chunks (76s)-then we embed again check previous (79s)-videos but embedding is converting (82s)-text into numbers or vector numbers (85s)-basically decimal points (88s)-uh in uh thousands of Dimensions so (93s)-it''s the whole purpose is to help make (95s)-it easier for computers to understand (97s)-and work with words and be able to match (100s)-them (101s)-and find uh similar words (106s)-so these embedded (108s)-texts are then stored in the vector (111s)-store (113s)-it''s just a database or storage for (116s)-these numbers that now represent the (120s)-words from your website (122s)-now (124s)-here''s where it gets interesting (126s)-so when a user asks a question let''s say (129s)-they ask a question (131s)-how do I become more productive (136s)-we don''t just want to throw that forward (139s)-to (141s)-you know Skip that whole this whole (143s)-process jump here (145s)-where we spoke about in the last video (147s)-where effectively this question will (150s)-draw out relevant documents from the (153s)-vector store we''ll combine that question (155s)-with the relevant documents as contacts (158s)-is sent to the model (160s)-here we want to actually (163s)-take into account the chat history (166s)-because if you''ve noticed with chat gbt (169s)-you can you can ask it a question (172s)-and then have a chain of interactions (175s)-and it still remembers what you said (178s)-previously so we want to capture the (183s)-chat history (185s)-as we go along as the user goes along to (188s)-ask more questions I hope that makes (190s)-sense I''ll explain more in the code so (192s)-we get that question (194s)-we combined it with the chat history (197s)-then we ask gpt3 can you please create a (201s)-standalone question from the history and (203s)-the question (205s)-we use that Standalone question to (207s)-extract documents (209s)-relevant documents from the vector store (211s)-again (213s)-if you are not familiar from previous (216s)-videos this gets converted into an (220s)-embedding just like here so now you have (224s)-numbers (225s)-matched against numbers we find the most (229s)-relevant number of pairs (231s)-then we can uh (234s)-draw the text from your website (237s)-associated with those similar number (239s)-pairs right so we get those relevant (242s)-documents (244s)-we provide his Contacts Plus the (246s)-Standalone question in the prompt so (249s)-that''s the instruction (250s)-we send it to llam which gpt3 or (254s)-whatever you''re using and we get the (256s)-answer so the answer could be something (259s)-like one of the most effective ways to (261s)-be productive is to create time blocks (263s)-during the day Focus work and then you (265s)-can also give the bot the ability to (268s)-provide references so you can learn more (270s)-in this guide at mywebsite.com guide (274s)-what''s pretty cool about this is (278s)-unlike (279s)-a situation where it''s just one-off (281s)-conversation you can now the user can (284s)-ask a question about this and (288s)-effectively get a response back and (290s)-create a chat but uh activity with your (294s)-website (295s)-so how are we going to do this in this (297s)-demo we''re going to be working with (301s)-this website so Thomas Frank is (305s)-uh someone I''ve followed for a while (307s)-he''s um he''s a productivity expert well (310s)-most (311s)-uh mostly Focus now on notion (314s)-and his tutorials are really really good (318s)-um but the some of them are also really (320s)-really long the uh one of his most (322s)-recent tutorials (324s)-uh was two hours about using the API for (329s)-notion (331s)-so you can see all these guides here (334s)-and I just thought you know what it''ll (336s)-be pretty cool since I''m both interested (339s)-in what he has to say and also very (341s)-interested in notion (343s)-to create a chatbot (345s)-based on his website (348s)-specifically his notion guides and I (351s)-think (352s)-I''ve been able to (356s)-effectively create a chapel out of (359s)-almost 50 000 words something crazy like (363s)-that I''m gonna walk through that with (364s)-you but effectively what''s the what''s (367s)-the first step when you see a website (369s)-you have many options you can call the (372s)-website you know go (374s)-recursively through what''s known as a (377s)-breadth first (379s)-algorithm to get the (382s)-the URLs of every page (385s)-that''s a bit Advanced you can (388s)-figure out what URLs you want to work (391s)-with ahead of time that''s kind of what (393s)-I''ve done because the website (395s)-has (399s)-not too many URLs to work with (403s)-and so I just manually pulled out the (405s)-ones I wanted to use (407s)-yeah this is the crash course I was (409s)-saying I think this is even this is (411s)-about 15 000 words the video is two and (414s)-a half hours (415s)-so not to say that we should have (418s)-watched the video but I think it''d be (420s)-pretty cool to (422s)-be able to ask questions about what''s in (426s)-this website (427s)-and so once you have (430s)-an idea of how you want to work with the (433s)-website (434s)-you just want to hear your developer (436s)-tools so that''s control shift J (439s)-on Windows (441s)-I think I''m not sure why it is or Mac (443s)-and (445s)-you just want to have an idea of the (447s)-structure of the website (449s)-so this is just basic CSS HTML (453s)-but what you''re basically looking for is (455s)-consistency across pages so what do I (458s)-mean so right there if you see where I (460s)-hovered it''s a H1 with an entry so it''s (463s)-a H1 tag (465s)-and it has a class of Entry title (468s)-and that is consistent with all the (470s)-pages (473s)-and if you go further down (475s)-you can see the content (478s)-is all within (481s)-div called entry content (485s)-and so right there already already have (489s)-two reference points to work with (492s)-when it comes time to crawling the (495s)-website to extract the information (498s)-so you just want to analyze (502s)-the key elements of the page you want to (505s)-extract (506s)-and once you have that down (509s)-so you know okay I''ve got the title I''ve (512s)-got the the body of the text (517s)-and then you also want to make sure that (519s)-it''s not a JavaScript loaded page (524s)-because if it is you can still use (528s)-something like Puppeteer this is for the (531s)-JavaScript typescript devs (534s)-um (535s)-but I just generally find it much easier (537s)-to work with websites that most of the (541s)-data is loaded uh straight away it''s (544s)-it''s more static by Nature (547s)-so that way you can use something like (550s)-Cheerio which is a package I''m going to (553s)-show you in a second and what it does (555s)-effectively (557s)-passes through the HTML of your (562s)-uh of the webs of uh positive HTML that (566s)-you provide after you make a get request (569s)-to a page (571s)-so cool so yeah this is pretty (573s)-straightforward you know so you it (575s)-depends what else you want to extract (577s)-and then once you''ve kind of decided (580s)-what you want to get out of (583s)-the document (585s)-um (586s)-of of the pages rather (590s)-so now it''s time to Let''s jump into code (593s)-so I''ll just show you how it works and (596s)-this is a super bass line change so (599s)-we''re going to be using Super Bass as a (601s)-vector store I if you know where a (604s)-certain base is a very uh easy to use (607s)-postgres database it''s open source and (612s)-land changes recently (615s)-uh made uh had created an integration (619s)-with Super Bass so this is the first (621s)-video on it so hopefully you find it (623s)-useful (625s)-so what you need to do here is run this (628s)-script scrape embed (631s)-so it''s just an npm run scrape embed (635s)-now before you do that let me just run (638s)-through (639s)-first of all you need your Super Bass (642s)-URL your Super Bass a non-key and (645s)-service roll key (648s)-so let''s jump into should we jump into (651s)-suitcase actually let''s just carry on (652s)-for a second I''m going to come back to (654s)-that let me just give you an overview (656s)-once you get those keys (659s)-you just want to run the script scrape (662s)-embed (663s)-scrape embed is going to (669s)-take you here so what it does is (672s)-you provide in this case I provided (677s)-these uh guides or these guides the (681s)-thousands of words (683s)-you provide those guides into (686s)-you can change it to whatever you want (688s)-to use (689s)-but the URLs effectively (692s)-go in here so extract data from urls (696s)-you can see the function runs (699s)-with the urls (701s)-and then for each URL extracts data from (704s)-the URL so we have a custom web loader I (707s)-made (708s)-that uses Cheerios as I said cherry or (711s)-pauses (712s)-and Cheerio first we fetch make get (715s)-requested URL get the HTML (718s)-and then return it to (721s)-uh Chariot to load so Chariot passes (725s)-through (725s)-we extract the data that we''re looking (727s)-for again it depends on you you clean it (730s)-up (731s)-then we create a new document so this is (734s)-from Lang chain and this is the format (736s)-that you want to get anything you''re (739s)-loading from into so a document is (742s)-effectively page content (745s)-which is a string and metadata which is (748s)-effectively an object that consists of (753s)-string and any pairs right so it can be (758s)-any string and string property and value (763s)-can be anything (766s)-so that''s how that works in a nutshell (771s)-and so once you run that script (774s)-you should see (777s)-right here so we say the Json file it''s (780s)-going to show up here and then you (784s)-should see (786s)-the next section where we embed the (789s)-document (790s)-we pass in the Super Bass client (792s)-which was (795s)-created in the (799s)-utils folder (802s)-we pass in the docs which is in the (804s)-format of the document as I said and (807s)-then you open the eye embedding so you (809s)-can imagine what''s going on in under the (811s)-hood (812s)-is what I showed in the diagram right (816s)-because (818s)-basically now we have the raw dots and (822s)-so we''re gonna (823s)-go through this process of splitting (825s)-into chunks and then embedding (830s)-so we split the docks into trunks (833s)-and then we embed (835s)-and then when we embed (837s)-we combine the dogs the relevant dogs (840s)-and the prompt and the question we sent (843s)-to you l m but that''s a separate section (846s)-this is just the embedding of the docs ", "start": 0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 849}]}, {"chapter_start": 849, "chapter_title": "PLACEHOLDER_CHAPTER_1", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(849s)-and so we can even just demo a query (852s)-here (856s)-let''s see how do I (860s)-create a database (863s)-so demo query what this script will do (866s)-is just show you how (870s)-a vector DBA chain dbqa chain which is (874s)-basically (876s)-um just going into the vector base (878s)-getting similar documents combinary (880s)-question and get a responses a very (882s)-simplified version of what we just (884s)-looked at (885s)-and so it''s just good to test this out (888s)-so I''m just going to (891s)-run (899s)-you can create a script for this I know (901s)-this is tedious (903s)-but I just want to show you (905s)-so now we want to (909s)-ask this question how do I create a oh (912s)- database (915s)-save that (917s)-press enter (925s)-whoops (927s)-uh (931s)-I think I did it wrong (934s)-oh yeah (936s)-cool (938s)-it''s actually Scripts (941s)-demo (947s)-should see your response in a second (964s)-just close this down (973s)-there we go so this is the response you (976s)-can create a notion database by (977s)-duplicating a free template blah blah (979s)-blah you can also add so I just want to (982s)-show you (983s)-you know you can run this script (985s)-yourself but it''s just showing you in a (988s)-nutshell that all is good all is working (991s)-and now (993s)-it''s just a matter of putting the pieces (995s)-together so (997s)-with that in mind this again (999s)-the GitHub repo is going to be available (1001s)-and the image is all so don''t worry you (1005s)-can you can always come back and get (1007s)-this but what are we trying to get to (1009s)-this is the end goal (1011s)-of this (1012s)-uh (1014s)-tutorial so (1016s)-this is pretty much what we''re working (1019s)-towards so if I just jump in here (1023s)-so again this is a website I built (1025s)-around all the guides from this website (1028s)-from Thomas Frank''s website (1031s)-and so (1034s)-here is his face I tell him what you''d (1037s)-like to learn about an ocean so again (1039s)-ask the same question how do I (1041s)-create a notion database (1045s)-press enter (1047s)-we should see a response (1052s)-once you''ve chosen you can duplicate (1056s)-cool (1057s)-now this is the moment of truth (1060s)-is the link gonna work (1063s)-is it gonna work (1065s)-oh no it didn''t let''s see this one (1069s)-oh that one worked awesome (1072s)-so that''s good at least we got one to (1075s)-work but that''s the general gist so if I (1078s)-say something like (1080s)-um (1082s)-how do I automate (1086s)-right in ocean (1089s)-uh how do I ultimately (1092s)-repetitive test (1096s)-lotion (1098s)-let''s see what happens (1100s)-what are you going to say now Tom (1102s)-what''s she gonna say (1106s)-interesting (1110s)-notion automation YouTube data cool (1114s)-uh let''s see now let me try and ask an (1116s)-irrelevant question so let''s say (1120s)-um (1121s)-What is love (1127s)-I wonder what it''s going to say back (1130s)-exactly and so it was pretty cool is now (1134s)-I can say if the user doesn''t understand (1137s)-a response I could say uh what do you (1141s)-mean by (1146s)-um (1148s)-uh let''s see says automation buildup by (1152s)-and (1153s)-automation Builder (1158s)-Builder let''s see what''s going to happen (1167s)-that''s awesome man (1170s)-that is cool (1172s)-and this is the massive guide that he (1174s)-wrote as well that is super cool (1178s)-yeah this is this worked better than I (1180s)-thought so (1182s)-that''s just a demo real quick (1185s)-now let''s jump into Super Bass because I (1189s)-think that''s the only thing I haven''t (1190s)-explained in previous tutorials (1193s)-so (1194s)-first of all what happened (1196s)-when the embedding was done (1199s)-in previous tutorials we did on pycon (1203s)-now we''re using something called PG (1205s)-Vector right it''s an extension on Super (1208s)-Bass (1209s)-and let me just go through the setup (1211s)-real quick (1213s)-so you take this schema (1216s)-here (1218s)-this enables the extension the vector (1220s)-this is your table this is a function a (1224s)-remote procedure called function that (1226s)-runs (1227s)-from your (1230s)-server (1231s)-and what it does is it does the (1234s)-compassion check (1236s)-the aspect of the diagram where We (1239s)-compare the queries Vector to (1241s)-be (1243s)-vectors in the vector vector base to (1246s)-find the ones that are similar so this (1248s)-sign here is a (1250s)-cosine similarity sign (1253s)-and then index for speeding things up so (1256s)-you can copy all of that (1258s)-and then you hop back into Super Bass (1262s)-go on the escrow editor (1264s)-now I''m assuming you''ve already set up (1266s)-your database it''s not too hard to do (1269s)-that (1270s)-and then in here you paste it in and you (1273s)-run (1275s)-once you run go back to table editor (1277s)-you''ll see documents (1279s)-when you click on documents (1282s)-you will see an it will be empty right (1285s)-this is the setup in the beginning (1288s)-you can also go up here and do what''s (1290s)-known as row level security (1293s)-what that does effectively is protects (1295s)-your database for people (1298s)-doing things like inserts and things or (1300s)-updating things without your permission (1302s)-so here I set one that enables read (1305s)-access for all users (1307s)-that''s the only thing they''re allowed to (1308s)-do so they cannot insert they cannot (1311s)-update (1313s)-if we jump back into database (1315s)-you can see that''s going to functions (1319s)-you can see the match document function (1323s)-and then we can see the extensions of (1326s)-the vector extension this is the PG (1328s)-Vector the effective knee and does the (1331s)-storage of embeddings (1334s)-um (1335s)-and also does the similarity checks so (1338s)-that''s pretty cool (1340s)-and then down here you can go get your (1342s)-API keys (1345s)-your URL and your non URL I''m not going (1349s)-to click that because you''re going to (1350s)-see what mine looks like (1352s)-but I think you get the gist (1355s)-in general this is what the embeddings (1359s)-will look like (1360s)-if you''ve wondered (1362s)-so here we have the content (1365s)-right because we split the embeddings (1366s)-remember into chunks so this is a chunk (1371s)-this is metadata that I collected for (1373s)-each chunk (1374s)-so I have a reference to (1377s)-where the data came from (1381s)-and then we have the vectors themselves (1385s)-this is (1386s)-this is what is compared to and there''s (1389s)-I think (1391s)-1536 vectors for openai (1394s)-and that''s it basically in a nutshell so (1396s)-you can see this (1398s)-there''s tons of pages of (1401s)-of his guides (1404s)-and I think that''s basically the Super (1406s)-Bass setup (1408s)-I''m gonna post uh put a link to this (1412s)-guide by Greg very useful it just gives (1415s)-an overview of PG vector and how it (1417s)-works (1419s)-explains embeddings better than I I can (1423s)-you can see it''s just similarities of of (1426s)-numbers (1428s)-um and it just gives an overview of (1430s)-Super Bass and how Super Bass works so I (1434s)-think if you''re not familiar with Super (1435s)-Bass definitely check this article out (1438s)-and have a feel for it (1441s)-cool (1442s)-so (1444s)-in a nutshell (1446s)-we basically (1448s)-have taken if I just hop back in a (1451s)-second (1454s)-here (1457s)-so nutshell (1459s)-we (1461s)-all right hold on a sec let me show you (1463s)-the chat history real quick (1466s)-so that makes sense to you (1469s)-so this is the index (1473s)-you can see we have a message state (1476s)-so the message State consists of the (1479s)-array of messages (1481s)-pending (1483s)-which is pending messages to come and (1486s)-history (1487s)-and so (1489s)-if you see we''re continuously building a (1493s)-stack of messages and history (1496s)-which we''re also using use memo to (1500s)-cachet (1501s)-and if you see when we do make the query (1505s)-to the server we pass the question and (1508s)-the history (1510s)-then the server (1512s)-catches that (1516s)-sanitizes that (1518s)-and effectively uses the question and (1522s)-the history (1523s)-to make a call to the language the llm (1526s)-or the open UI right (1529s)-so I hope that makes sense (1531s)-why we''re kind of capturing these two (1535s)-because otherwise there will be no (1537s)-interaction (1538s)-back and forth between the user and the (1541s)-chatbot (1542s)-so that was the chat and History Section (1547s)-the chat questions section then the (1550s)-Standalone question also inside the (1553s)-chain.com that you just saw (1555s)-and this is the draw where Super Bass (1558s)-will pull out the relevant docs for the (1562s)-vector base using PG vector (1564s)-pastor llm we get a response and that''s (1567s)-it (1568s)-so now we have (1571s)-a simple chatbot for your website (1575s)-very simple so let me just ask Tom one (1577s)-more question (1579s)-and the question will be (1582s)-let''s just hop in the website and see (1584s)-what we can ask him (1587s)-okay (1591s)-let''s say what are some peaceful (1595s)-formulas (1599s)-let''s see what happens (1609s)-nice (1612s)-um (1614s)-how do I (1617s)-use (1620s)-let''s go to (1629s)-how do I (1634s)-create (1636s)-page in motion (1649s)-nice nice (1651s)-this is not bad (1654s)-hey tell me if you''re watching this (1656s)-hit me up but anyway (1659s)-um yeah this this is yeah this is fun to (1662s)-make and I I hope you found it useful (1663s)-and you got a good overview in terms of (1666s)-just (1667s)-making a chatbot for a website obviously (1669s)-on a bigger scale you''re gonna have to (1672s)-crawl the website get all the URLs and (1674s)-do some q a and all of that but this is (1676s)-a very very basic example using Lang (1679s)-chain on how to (1682s)-create a chatbot for your website (1686s)-if you have any questions or feedback or (1689s)-ideas for future videos just hit me up (1691s)-cheers ", "start": 849, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1",

if it''s on your finger they (18s)-will think you know (21s)- (32s)-so in the Indian society when something (36s)-goes wrong for let''s say someone is not (39s)-well (40s)-so there are three types of people (43s)-ones who go to the hospital then there (46s)-are the ones who rush to the temples and (48s)-then there are the third ones who rush (49s)-to the astrologers (51s)-so we are actually (55s)-taught from the beginning that (58s)-inanimate objects and things around us (62s)-have the power to control Our Lives for (66s)-example uh the the (69s)-this (70s)-um for example my mother when uh two to (72s)-three years back told me to wear a ring (75s)-which had a gemstones I still had it on (77s)-have it on because (78s)-of course because that''s what mama said (81s)-so you need to take it over the way the (83s)-boys will think (93s)-a good luck you keep it in the pocket if (95s)-it''s on your finger they will think your (97s)-foreign (101s)-human life is made in such a way (104s)-particularly human life (106s)-for all the animals Nature has fixed (109s)-clear-cut path (111s)-what they can do what they cannot do (113s)-their lives happen within between two (116s)-lines they cannot go below that they (118s)-cannot go about that within that they (120s)-live that''s why they look so sure and (122s)-certain and they''re peaceful (125s)-once their stomach is full they''re all (127s)-peaceful do you see this hello (131s)-are you on talking terms with me or no (133s)-one (137s)-do you see all the animals once their (140s)-stomach is full (141s)-they are peaceful (143s)-but human beings are thinking are they (145s)-being taught (147s)-that peace is the ultimate goal of life (152s)-a buffalo full stomach who sits (155s)-peacefully and for you that is the (157s)-ultimate goal what a shame (160s)-yeah (161s)-what a buffalo can do with the stomach (165s)-full of grass or whatever else he eats (167s)-you have to hold it as the ultimate goal (170s)-is it not a shame I''m asking (174s)-but (177s)-this is being thought like this piece is (179s)-the ultimate goal of your life (182s)-but (183s)-coming to more fundamentals if you are (186s)-not peaceful today can you enjoy your (188s)-dinner today (190s)-hmm no can you just enjoy walking down (194s)-the street (195s)-can you enjoy the company of a few (197s)-people around you no if not ecstatic at (201s)-least you must be peaceful (203s)-to enjoy anything in your life so I am (205s)-asking should it be the first step in (207s)-your life or the last step in your life (209s)-such people will only rest in peace (215s)-now do other things have influence on us (218s)-particularly inanimate objects (223s)-the gems and the Diamonds (226s)-and things like that and also the (228s)-planets (231s)-see the nature of the planet has a (235s)-certain influence on the life upon it (239s)-you will see on Full Moon days and New (241s)-Moon days many animals behave in certain (244s)-specific ways simply because they are (246s)-influenced by it you know the whole (248s)-ocean is rising (251s)-when ocean which is millions and (254s)-millions of tons of water is able to (257s)-rise (259s)-when 72 percent of your body is water (262s)-you think it won''t rise at all (265s)-it does (269s)-so (271s)-I don''t know if you''re conscious of it (273s)-but in India most people are not only in (276s)-India in anywhere wherever there are (277s)-mental asylums and things they are (279s)-conscious of It On full moon days and (281s)-New Moon days people get exaggerated (284s)-levels of disturbance in their minds (287s)-so people think new moon and full moon (289s)-will cause Madness no that''s not the (291s)-truth (292s)-if you''re very loving (295s)-full moon day you will become more (296s)-loving (297s)-if you''re very joyful on a full moon day (300s)-you will become more joyful if you''re a (302s)-little crazy you''ll get a little more (304s)-crazy whatever is your quality gets (307s)-little hyped on that day (310s)-so those who are romantic they want full (313s)-moon day (314s)-those who want to meditate they want (316s)-full moon day those who are little mad (318s)-they don''t want full moon day (322s)-essentially it''s hyping things up a (325s)-little bit (325s)-of course today there is another kind of (328s)-textbook science which is going on which (330s)-doesn''t observe anything except what (332s)-happens in the laboratory (335s)-these people are going on saying this is (337s)-all rubbish this is that (339s)-no if you pay attention to your own body (341s)-you will know without looking up without (343s)-looking at the calendar you will know (345s)-when is full Monday when is New Monday (347s)-by yourself simply if you pay sufficient (350s)-attention to your own system because (352s)-it''s visible in your system certain (354s)-behavior is there but with a human being (357s)-the problem is or (360s)-people seeing it a problem (362s)-any pro any possibility if you do not (366s)-explore that possibility in your eyes it (369s)-looks like a problem (371s)-what is a problem is always a (373s)-possibility isn''t it (376s)-you don''t like it (381s)-what is the possibility (383s)-if you do not explore it if you do not (385s)-realize what is the possibility it seems (388s)-like a problem to you (390s)-so do inanimate things have impact on (394s)-you yes if you will love it because this (397s)-is the human predicament that who you (400s)-are is not determined by Nature it is (402s)-left open for you (403s)-left open for you means you are the only (406s)-creature on this planet who has been (408s)-given the freedom to shape your own life (411s)-is it a small thing this is a product of (416s)-millions of years of evolution that (418s)-today after all these creatures from a (421s)-single-celled animal to after this (423s)-millions of forms here we are sitting (425s)-this is the only creature which can (428s)-shape its own life the way it wants (431s)-every other creature has to live by the (434s)-laws of nature we can shape our own (437s)-lives (438s)-it is this Freedom that human beings are (441s)-suffering if you''re suffering your (442s)-bondage it''s all right if you''re (445s)-suffering your freedom freedom you''re a (447s)-disaster isn''t it (454s)-you''re suffering your bondages you''re (456s)-chained to something you''re suffering (457s)-that understandable (459s)-but you are suffering because you are (462s)-free most human beings are suffering (465s)-because they are free they are always (467s)-trying to bind themselves to something (469s)-or somebody all the time because Freedom (472s)-scares them (474s)-because freedom is a padless path (478s)-Freedom Is An Open terrain there''s no (481s)-fixed line because there is no fixed (485s)-pathway most people feel terrified (490s)-but (491s)-the highest value in human life is (493s)-freedom isn''t it so (495s)-hello (497s)-in this culture (499s)-the highest value in this culture is not (501s)-God not heaven mukti Moksha Liberation (506s)-freedom is the highest value (509s)-established that no matter what you do (513s)-you must seek mukti you can do whatever (515s)-you do with your life but all that (518s)-process should be towards your (519s)-Liberation you must be moving towards (521s)-higher and higher levels of freedom on a (523s)-daily basis otherwise your life is not (526s)-worth it because you''re getting (527s)-entangled with the process of life (534s)-even if you go to heaven it''s an (536s)-entanglement (539s)-see (540s)-I''m sure before you join the IIT (544s)-you still keeping Bombay right I see (549s)-before you joined IIT (551s)-when you have written your ad you know (553s)-whatever entrance tests and stuff (556s)-only thing is somehow I want to get in I (558s)-want to get in because it it''s like (560s)-heaven entering heaven (562s)-no matter what I want to get in that''s (564s)-the only thing I want after you get in (566s)-see how many problems (573s)- (576s)-I am asking you a simple question (579s)-being on this planet (582s)-do you have any proof (584s)-that you are not already in heaven and (586s)-making a mess out of it (591s)-do you have any proof (594s)-suppose you took off from the solar (596s)-system and looked down at the solar (598s)-system whatever these 12 14 planets and (601s)-satellites and works (603s)-does planet Earth definitely look like a (605s)-Heavenly Body among all these (607s)-yes or no so you are already on heaven (611s)-and making a mess out of it and now you (613s)-want to go to another heaven (618s)-this culture does not value heaven (621s)-does not value God (623s)-values only Freedom we want to be even (626s)-free from the creation and the Creator (629s)-mukti Moksha is the ultimate value (632s)-because (634s)-this is not a philosophical value this (637s)-is not a religious value this is (639s)-something every life is longing for only (641s)-thing is most human beings are (644s)-short-sighted that they long for it in (646s)-installments (649s)-see whatever people are seeking right (651s)-now (652s)-if they have nothing they will say if I (655s)-get 100 rupees per day Shiva that''s all (657s)-I want that''s a prayer (659s)-100 rupees fell (661s)-100 rupees fine fine three days hundred (664s)-rupees fine fourth day only 100 rupees (666s)-Shiva what''s the problem with you are (669s)-you so stingy at least a thousand rupees (671s)-a day (673s)-okay thousand rupee notes is it in legal (675s)-tender thousand rupino (684s)-foreign (698s)-wonderful Shiva fantastic (700s)-after 10 days oh only two thousand (703s)-rupees (705s)-it doesn''t matter how much it falls (708s)-something more something more something (710s)-more isn''t it this is not about money (713s)-people think it''s about money people (715s)-think it''s about wealth power pleasure (718s)-love knowledge no these are all (720s)-different currencies (722s)-essentially you''re looking for expansion (725s)-because you feel suffocated (728s)-if we keep you in the same place for too (730s)-long you feel suffocated you want (731s)-expansion you want to be something more (734s)-all the time (735s)-yes or no (737s)-always something more will you settle (740s)-with fulfillment (741s)-no you will look at other planets you (743s)-look at the new galaxies (745s)-so there is something within a human (747s)-being which wants to expand limitlessly (751s)-that means it wants to be free nothing (753s)-else looking at this carefully observing (757s)-the nature of the life within that it (759s)-wants to expand in a limitless way the (762s)-only thing it is longing for is to (763s)-become boundless (765s)-that means it''s seeking Freedom that is (767s)-why in this culture we established the (770s)-highest value is mukti or Moksha which (773s)-means liberation of Freedom not heaven (776s)-not because heaven is just another place (779s)-maybe little better accommodations (782s)-but same trouble after some time isn''t (784s)-it (786s)- ", "start": 1, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1",

(44s)-They allow you to have really\neasy access onto systems. (47s)-But you either have to regenerate a new\none every time you get a computer, (50s)-and then go to GitHub,\ngo to stash, go to Bitbucket, (52s)-go to wherever you have to go, GitLab. (54s)-And reput them all in, and\nthen wherever else you have to go, really, (57s)-really annoying. (59s)-Well, Ansible comes with\nsomething called ansible-vault. (62s)-Now this thing is pretty darn awesome. (64s)-So I''m gonna give you\na little quick example, okay? (66s)-So let''s come in here and\nlet''s create a file, all right? (70s)-And let''s call this one, wow,\nI already have a test file. (73s)-What''s in here? (73s)-My goodness, hello FrontEnd Masters. (75s)-Look at this, we already have a test file. (76s)-How beautiful is this? (78s)-So I''m gonna take this thing down and\nI''m gonna run ansible-vault, (83s)-and then I''m gonna encrypt and\nI''m gonna choose testfile, right? (88s)-And it''s gonna say, hey,\ngive me a password. (90s)-So I''m gonna type in\na super secret password. (94s)-And then I''m gonna do it again,\nand that''s that. (97s)-It''s gonna say, encryption successful. (98s)-So let''s cat out the testfile,\nthere we go. (101s)-Now this is what the testfile looks like. (103s)-I could commit this to a public repo. (105s)-AES256 is said to be\nlikely quantum secure. (109s)-So at least for the next while, (111s)-you''re gonna be safe using\nthis type of encryption. (113s)-It seems pretty good. (116s)-And you can store it on public repos. (117s)-There you go, it''s out there,\neverything''s fine. (119s)-And if I wanted to get out the value,\nI could do ansible-vault decrypt, and (124s)-then, oop, don''t wanna put that one\nout there, and then do testfile. (129s)-And I could decrypt the testfile,\nput in my super secret password. (132s)-And now when I cat out my testfile,\nwhat do I see? (135s)-Hello, FrontEnd Masters. (136s)-So it''s a two-way encryption\nthat works really nicely. (139s)-But you''re probably asking yourself,\nokay, that''s neat. (143s)-And now I don''t have to store my SSH\nkeys in my email or on a private server. (148s)-I can actually do that. (149s)-But still, that''s kind of manual, right? (151s)-I''d have to decrypt them,\nmove them into the correct location. (154s)-I don''t wanna do that, right? (156s)-I don''t wanna do it. (157s)-I don''t wanna be a part of any of that. (158s)-You''re right, you don''t wanna do that,\nand you don''t have to do that. (162s)-So I''ve included the code, but I''m only\ngonna just lightly go over the code. (167s)-Cuz I looked it up on the Internet,\nI cut, I pasted it, (171s)-it worked first try, it was beautiful. (175s)-I defined a couple of vars,\nwhere my current SSH key is, (178s)-where I want to install it. (180s)-Some basic information about it like, hey, (181s)-I wanna create a directory with\nthe correct permissions, say, 700, right? (185s)-I want to be able to copy my\nsource to my destination. (188s)-I''ve also tagged it with dotfiles and SSH. (191s)-So if I install my dotfiles, I also\nneed to install these tasks as well. (196s)-I need to have my SSH keys up and running\nfor my dotfiles to be properly running. (200s)-I do a bunch of this other stuff,\nset my authorized key so that it works so (203s)-I can have both. (204s)-So I''m using it from here on out. (206s)-If I do a Git operation,\nit''s gonna be ensured to be working. (210s)-And, of course,\nI can do something that looks like this. (212s)-I can go and\nI can clone down a public repo, and (215s)-then update my submodules,\nwhich are private. (219s)-And it will use my SSH key that\nI just got done decrypting. (222s)-So let me show you kind\nof what that looks like. (224s)-Here''s effectively the exact\nthing we will be executing. (228s)-So I''m gonna go like this. (229s)-I''m gonna rerun a new docker, and (232s)-I''m gonna just use my actual\nAnsible thing I''ve been using. (238s)-So here''s my Ansible. (239s)-So I''m gonna go ansible-playbook,\nand I''m gonna run dotfiles. (243s)-That''s my tag for all my dotfiles cuz\nI want things to be up and running. (246s)-And then I''m gonna also do ask-vault-pass,\nright? (251s)-And then on top of that,\nI''m gonna just specify local.yml. (255s)-Now I''m gonna put in my\nvery secret passcode. (261s)-Don''t look at it too much, there we go. (263s)-And there we go. (265s)-It''s gonna go through. (265s)-It''s gonna ensure that SSH\nis installed correctly. (268s)-And it''s gonna go through and\ninstall all my zsh, zsh, all that, (272s)-make sure vim plug is there. (274s)-It''s gonna install that stows there. (275s)-It''s gonna clone down\nmy dotfile repository. (278s)-Not only that, but it''s gonna\nrecursively get everything else with it. (281s)-It''s gonna stow my dotfiles. (282s)-You don''t know what stow is yet. (284s)-Then it''s gonna get a bunch of my personal\nprojects that I need, and boom, it''s done. (288s)-Now I''m gonna open up nvim. (289s)-It''s gonna have some errors because I''ve\nyet to figure out this one how to make (291s)-this thing work, but\nthen I''m just gonna go PlugInstall. (294s)-And once it goes through and does all of\nthis, all right, blah blah blah blah blah, (299s)-there we go. (300s)-Look how beautiful that is. (302s)-Everything is wonderful. (303s)-There we go. (305s)-And now I can quit. (307s)-Quit, when I reopen up vim,\nit''s now in the way I would like it. (310s)-All my keyboard shortcuts work. (312s)-I can do everything that I wanted to do,\noopsies. (315s)-Everything just works as is. (317s)-Because now, my vim''s up and running and\nall my dotfiles have been there and (320s)-they are private with an SSH key. (322s)-Now, for me, this was a huge thing. (324s)-That made me really excited. (326s)-Cuz I absolutely just hated how\nI''ve handled SSH keys in the past. (330s)-This is awesome. (331s)-Now it just works. (333s)-And I can have them stored in a place\nwhere I''m not gonna lose them, right? (337s)-And that''s a big thing for me is that I\ndon''t wanna have to regenerate them and (339s)-I don''t wanna lose them. (340s)-And I don''t want them just on\nsomeplace that can get hacked. (343s)-I want them secure. (344s)-And I feel like this was one of\nthe best solutions I''ve seen out there, (347s)-where I can get a system up and running\neven with those private keys so quick. (351s)-And I feel like this is one of the biggest\nselling points of Ansible, but (354s)-I wanna kinda think about it for a second. (357s)-Besides for SSH keys, what else\ncould we store with ansible-vault? (363s)-Well, I feel like everybody here probably\nknows what this symbol is, right? (369s)-How many of you are locked out of Binance\nright now because you have lost your (374s)-password and you don''t have your\nbackup codes for Binance, right? (378s)-My goodness,\nyou can''t get your cryptocurrencies. (381s)-Your millions of Dogecoin just sitting\nthere being wasted away right now. (385s)-It''s because you don''t have a way to\nstore your private information easily. (391s)-So something I''ve been doing is I''ve\nactually been going through my auth codes. (395s)-And here we go.\nHere''s my Discord backup codes, right? (398s)-All right, so\nif I get locked out of Discord, (400s)-I have my backup codes already here,\nready to rock. (403s)-I don''t even have to worry about it. (405s)-For me, this was just like a huge\nthing cuz it''s gonna save me 100-fold. (412s)-And so now, not only do I have all\nmy installation and everything. (415s)-I also have all the keys to\nthe kingdom in case things break, (418s)-in case I lose my phone, all that. (420s)-I just have to get to a computer and\nhave Ansible installed and (423s)-I can get the backup codes back out. (425s)-For me, this was just awesome. (427s)-This is just like such a selling point. (429s)-That''s why this talk, I felt like this\nsection went from the most boring section (433s)-to the most awesome section. (434s)-Because it''s just like, I''ve been screwed\nby this so many times in my lifetime and (438s)-I don''t have to have it anymore.

(479s)-If you don''t know what that is, or\nthe best way to kinda say it is that, (483s)-have you ever used Ctrl+P in VS Code,\nif that''s more familiar to you. (486s)-Ctrl+P brings up all of your files, right? (489s)-And you can start typing and it finds\nthe file with a few keystrokes, right? (493s)-That''s a fuzzy finder. (494s)-It means you can type a partial match\nto a string and it''ll return to you all (498s)-the strings in some sort of\nsorted order that makes sense. (501s)-Fzf has a lot of options, blah blah blah. (503s)-But it''s just a fuzzy finder. (505s)-It''s good to know. (506s)-This is very, very good to know. (508s)-All right, so I wanna be able\nto take these two things and (511s)-I wanna be able to create a Tmux\nexperience out of them, right? (515s)-I wanna take all these folders right\nhere and I wanna be able to navigate to (518s)-them instantly and\nI want to filter them via fzf. (522s)-So that is what I want to create. (523s)-And we''re gonna create that right now,\nbecause I want better, (528s)-faster, smoother navigation. (530s)-All right, that seems about right, right? (533s)-So we do know a command, right? (535s)-We did walk through this command earlier. (537s)-We can create a session and\nwe can name it. (540s)-We can detach it, awesome , right? (542s)-It''s beautiful, it''s exactly what we want. (545s)-But did you know, I know, my goodness,\nyou can create a new session? (549s)-And you can even say, hey, this is\nthe directory I want you to go to, right? (554s)-So we can actually even tell it\nwhat directory to go to with -c. (558s)-We can create a new window with\na directory it should go to. (562s)-And we can also call switch-client. (564s)-Switch-client will switch to a new client,\nand it uses this -t parameter. (570s)-Now the -t parameter,\nyou''ll put it on switch-client. (575s)-What would effectively it does,\nit allows you to put in a session name. (579s)-Now, I only ever use session name, but (581s)-you can''t even go further and\ndo window name and pane number. (587s)-So you can really give it a really\ntargeted string to jump to. (591s)-And so if you name your windows as well,\nyou could even fuzzy find into that. (596s)-You could list your sessions and\nthen fuzzy find across it and (599s)-jump in if you have really well\nnamed session and window schemes. (603s)-It''s pretty darn cool. (605s)-But I tend to just do session name foobar,\nright? (609s)-So right now,\njust kinda show to you, there''s bar. (612s)-That''s one of the sessions name is bar. (613s)-So we''re in foo right now. (614s)-So I can go tmux switch-client. (618s)-No, I didn''t spell that right at all. (620s)-And then do t and go foo, right? (622s)-And by doing that,\nwe are currently in foo. (625s)-I thought I was in bar. (626s)-So now instead, tricking you guys,\nmaking sure you''re paying attention, (630s)-we press bar and we jump over the bar. (632s)-So look at that,\nI programmatically switched session. (635s)-So we''re like, okay, (636s)-we have a lot of the tools here to\ncreate this style of navigation, right? (640s)-We know that there''s commands that\nexist that we can do this with. (644s)-We know what folders we want to do it. (648s)-And we know that we want the fuzzy\nfinder to be able to help us. (651s)-So there''s kind of a lot\nof things going on here. (654s)-And lastly, there''s another command that\nI have right here that we don''t need this (658s)-time, but we''re gonna need pretty near,\nor you may want soon, (661s)-is you can also include\na command right here. (664s)-So not only can you create a new\nwindow with a name, you can also say, (668s)-hey, run Node.js, whatever, right? (670s)-So you can actually tell\nit to do something. (673s)-And lastly,\nalways read the friendly manual. (676s)-I believe that''s what that\nabbreviation stands for, RTFM, (679s)-always read the friendly manual. (681s)-It''s very important to do that. (683s)-And so man tmux actually has a lot\nof information inside of it. (686s)-If you''re not familiar with man,\nwhich stands for manual, do man man. (690s)-It''ll tell you actually\nhow to read a manual and (693s)-what it means,\nwhat each one of these numbers mean. (696s)-Along with it, it''ll even tell you like,\nbold means type it exactly as shown, okay? (701s)-So let''s go back to tmux man. (702s)-Look at that, this means type\nit exactly like this, tmux. (706s)-It actually gives you\na lot of information. (708s)-And once you read through\nthe man''s manual, (710s)-it makes a lot more sense\nreading manual pages. (712s)-Actually they''re very, very nice, and (714s)-tmux is particularly nice\ncuz it has everything in it. (717s)-You''re confused at how\nswitch-client works. (720s)-Well, here you go,\nhere''s every single option, all of it. (723s)-Here''s the alias that it''s also known by. (725s)-Here''s everything that I can possibly do. (727s)-It''s very, very nice to learn these\ncommands using this little manual page. (730s)-I always recommend reading\nthe friendly manual. (734s)-So now we have our items we can easily\nsearch for and easily fuzzy find over. (739s)-Now obviously, I can make this a really\nbig list, but for the point of this, (743s)-I don''t think I need to make\nthis as big as possible. (746s)-It just needs to be obvious how it works. (748s)-So there we go,\nwe have these two things, and (750s)-now we need to select the thing we want. (752s)-So really, we could do fzf, right? (754s)-Pipe that into fzf, perfect. (756s)-So let''s just try it out. (758s)-Here we go, c, boom, c, beautiful. (761s)-Just always makes me feel so (763s)-good when things just work\nhow you want them to work. (765s)-So now, of course, selected,\nwe have one of those. (768s)-There we go, everything''s great,\nlook at that. (770s)-We''re practically done with our\nscript at this point, it''s fantastic. (774s)-Now I also learned this recently fumbling\naround trying to make the script a couple (778s)-of weeks ago on Twitch when people\nrepetitively told me that I am a script (781s)-kid and I don''t know what I''m doing. (783s)-Well, let me show you me\nknowing what I''m doing. (786s)-We''re gonna echo out languages, and\nwe''re gonna pipe it into grep, and (789s)-we''re gonna do qs. (790s)-Effectively, we''re making it silent. (791s)-We''re not returning the results and\nwe just want to know, (794s)-did we find it or did we not find it? (797s)-Is selected within the languages, right? (800s)-Cuz remember, if we look right here, (803s)-when we use languages,\nit''s like a different way we do it. (807s)-It''s a space delimited item. (809s)-When we use core utils,\nit''s not a space delimited item. (813s)-Again, my God, it''s so straight. (816s)-So here we go. (818s)-So let''s jump into here, go right there. (820s)-Let''s just prove it, right.? (822s)-Let''s go like this,\necho I AM LANGUAGE, right? (826s)-Take that fl, go here, and (829s)-then go I AM CORE YOUDIL,\nthere you go, YOUDIL. (835s)-That''s how I say it. (835s)-Is that normal? (836s)-Probably not. (837s)-All right, let''s cht.sh, let''s try it\nwith sed, I AM CORE YOUDIL, perfect. (841s)-Let''s try typescript. (842s)-I AM LANGUAGE, my goodness,\nthis is going so good. (846s)-Everything''s working. (846s)-By the way, this is how I develop bash. (848s)-For anyone that wants to know, whenever\nI''m doing bash type things, I go back and (852s)-forth like this a lot cuz bash is just,\nI never get it right. (856s)-This is such a hard language, I swear. (859s)-It feels so easy, but\nI get it wrong every single time. (862s)-We have this. (863s)-So now what we need to do is we need\nto create that curl command, right? (867s)-So let''s try this. (868s)-Let''s go like this, curl cht.sh, and\nthen we got our selected, right? (872s)-That''s the thing we selected. (874s)-And since we''re under the languages,\nall we gotta do now is go like this, echo. (878s)-We need a query, don''t we? (879s)-We need a query. (880s)-So let''s go like this, read -p,\nand that p stands for prompt. (885s)-Give me your query, right, there we go. (888s)-And we''re gonna make it\ngo into variable query. (891s)-So we''re gonna echo query down here and\nwe''re gonna pipe it into tr, right? (896s)-And tr, we''re gonna wanna replace\nevery space with plus signs. (899s)-Now for whatever reason, I''ve decided\nright here I wanna use single quotes, (903s)-which just seems asinine to use single\nquotes in one single spot in your entire (906s)-language. (907s)-There we go. (908s)-So this should do exactly\nwhat we think it should do. (910s)-It should curl cht.sh with\nour selected language, and (915s)-then have our plus delimited query string. (919s)-Down here, we''re gonna wanna do\nwith just a touch different. (922s)-Instead, we''re gonna wanna do that\nlittle tilde and go query, right? (925s)-Query, awesome, so\nthat should do the other part of it. (929s)-So if we do find exact, this should work. (931s)-So let''s find out. (931s)-Let''s go like this, let''s quit it. (934s)-Let''s go in here, wrong script. (936s)-And let''s go, I just quit vim. (938s)-Let''s open up vim cuz it\njust feels better, right? (940s)-There we go, let''s go over here. (942s)-And let''s go cht.sh, and\nlet''s use, did I add find? (945s)-I did add find. (946s)-So there we go, we got find. (946s)-Give me your query. (948s)-Let''s do exact, right? (949s)-All right, there''s everything that has\nto do with exact, right here, awesome. (953s)-So this is really working, right? (956s)-I feel like we''re really doing something,\nand I''m awesome. (959s)-Okay, this is looking good. (961s)-But the problem is we''re not\ntmuxed out of our mind yet. (964s)-Right now, we''re still just kind of\nlightly tmuxing, and I don''t want that. (967s)-I just want this to be\nthe greatest thing ever. (970s)-So how should we go about this? (972s)-So let''s think about that. (973s)-We have two options. (975s)-We could create a new pane, which I''ve\nnever done and someone suggested. (979s)-And honestly,\nit kinda feels like a great challenge. (982s)-So let''s try a new pane for a second. (983s)-If not, I''ll just fall back to\nthe way I already pre-planned. (986s)-But we''re going off script now, okay? (987s)-People, we''re going all in on this one,\nI know. (990s)-This has to be the one. (991s)-It has to be split. (992s)-Create a new pane by splitting\nthe target pane, okay? (996s)-Does a horizontal split,\nv does a vertical split, awesome. (999s)-Okay, so I''m a vertical kinda guy. (1002s)-So let''s try this out. (1003s)-So we''re gonna go with this,\ntmux split-window, and (1007s)-my guess is it''s -v for vertical. (1010s)-This is feeling good. (1011s)-We won''t provide a target cuz I''m gonna\nassume that if there''s no target, (1014s)-it does my current window. (1016s)-split-window, you never know, yeah,\nnever mind, split-window''s right here, (1018s)-shell-command. (1019s)-Okay,  all right, and\nwe even have starting directory we can do. (1023s)-Environment, we can provide\nenvironment variables. (1025s)-Really cool, by the way, that you\ncan provide environment variables. (1028s)-That means you could actually have certain\nthings in this, and you could start a db (1031s)-environment, which already has all\nyour connections and everything. (1035s)-A lot of cool things you can do here. (1036s)-So I think this should probably be okay. (1040s)-Let''s go like this, split-window\nvertically, and then let''s just do this. (1045s)-So let''s go like this. (1045s)-Let''s go bash -c and\nlet''s just pass this into less. (1050s)-Less is like a super\nduper ultra cool program. (1052s)-Okay, I''m gonna be, let''s see,\nwe got a lot of escaping to do here. (1057s)-Let''s escape with passion and theory. (1059s)-I don''t think I need to escape those ones. (1061s)-Let''s just see,\nI don''t think I need to escape anything. (1063s)-Let''s just find out. (1064s)-All right, so let''s do this again. (1067s)-I keep closing my vim command there for\na second. (1069s)-So let''s do cht.sh,\nlet''s do typescript, let''s do enum. (1073s)-And there we go, yes. (1074s)-First off, tmux is backwards,\nwhich part of me just feels very upset. (1079s)-And so let''s go back into vim now. (1081s)-And let''s go back to load cht.sh. (1083s)-So there we go. (1083s)-So we just piped into less so\nit would work. (1085s)-And then, of course, let''s fix that very\npoor vertical thing to make it horizontal. (1090s)-And let''s run it again, I closed vim\nagain, clearly out of my element here, (1095s)-enum, and there you go. (1097s)-Now I have this. (1098s)-And so now I can scroll around\nhere to see what''s going on. (1101s)-So obviously, there''s nothing here. (1102s)-So the moment I press Q, it quits. (1104s)-It also quits the split, we''re back here. (1106s)-That''s actually pretty cool. (1107s)-That''s a pretty good\nexperience right there.

every great (688s)-technological revolution in human (690s)-history although it has been true that (691s)-the jobs change a lot some jobs even go (694s)-away and I''m sure we''ll see a lot of (695s)-that here (697s)-human demand for new stuff human (699s)-creativity is Limitless and we find new (702s)-jobs we find new things to do they''re (703s)-hard to imagine from where we sit today (705s)-I certainly don''t know what they''ll be (708s)-um but I think the future will have all (711s)-sorts of wonderful new things we do that (712s)-you and I can''t even really imagine (714s)-today

so it''s not like this is something (743s)-that technology has not already made the (745s)-information available to but I think (747s)-that every incremental degree you make (750s)-that easier is something to avoid a (753s)-thing that I do worry about uh is we''re (755s)-not going to be the only creator of this (756s)-technology (757s)-there will be other people who don''t put (759s)-some of the safety limits that we put on (761s)-it Society I think has a limited amount (764s)-of time to figure out how to react to (766s)-that how to regulate that how to how to (768s)-handle it and how do you decide here at (772s)-open AI what goes in what shouldn''t (775s)-we have policy teams we have safety (778s)-teams we talk a lot to other groups in (781s)-the in the rest of the world (783s)-um we finished GPT for a very long time (785s)-ago it feels like a very long time ago (787s)-in this industry I think like seven (789s)-months ago something like that (790s)-um and since then we have been (792s)-internally externally talking to people (795s)-trying to make these decisions working (797s)-with red teamers talking to various (799s)-policy and safety experts getting audits (802s)-of the system to try to address these (804s)-issues and put something out that we (806s)-think is safe and good and who should be (809s)-defining those guard rails for society (811s)-Society should one society as a whole (814s)-how are we going to do that so I can (817s)-paint like a vision that I I find (819s)-compelling this will be one one way of (821s)-many that it could go (823s)-um if you had representatives from Major (826s)-World governments uh you know trusted (828s)-International institutions come together (830s)-and write a governing document you know (833s)-here is what the system should do here''s (836s)-what the system shouldn''t do here''s you (838s)-know very dangerous things that the (839s)-system should never touch even in a mode (841s)-where it''s creatively exploring (844s)-um and then developers of language (846s)-models like us use that as the governing (849s)-document you''ve said AI will likely (852s)-eliminate millions of jobs it could (854s)-increase racial bias misinformation (856s)-create machines that are smarter than (859s)-all of humanity combined (861s)-and other consequences so terrible we (864s)-can''t even imagine what they could be (867s)-many people are going to ask why on (870s)-Earth did you create this technology why (873s)-Sam (874s)-I think it can do the opposite of all of (876s)-those things too properly done it is (878s)-going to eliminate a lot of current jobs (880s)-that''s true (881s)-we can make much better ones so talking (884s)-about the downsides acknowledging the (885s)-downsides trying to avoid those while we (888s)-push in the direction of the upsides I (890s)-think that''s important and again very (892s)-early preview like would you push a (894s)-button to stop us if it meant we are no (896s)-longer able to cure all diseases would (898s)-you push a button to stop this if it (899s)-meant we couldn''t educate every child in (902s)-the world super well would you push a (903s)-button to stop this if it meant there (906s)-was a five percent chance it would be (907s)-the end of the world I would push a (909s)-button to slow it down and in fact I (911s)-think we will need to figure out ways to (913s)-slow down this technology over time 2024 (917s)-the next major election in the United (919s)-States (920s)-might not be on everyone''s mind but it (923s)-certainly is on yours (925s)-is this technology (928s)-going to have the kind of impact that (929s)-maybe social media has had on previous (931s)-elections and how can you guarantee (933s)-there won''t be those kind of problems (935s)-because of chat gbt (937s)-we don''t know is the honest answer we''re (939s)-monitoring very closely and and again we (942s)-can take it back we can turn things off (944s)-we can change the rules is this a Google (946s)-killer will people say I''m going to chat (948s)-gbt yet instead of Google it in the (950s)-future I think if you''re thinking about (951s)-this as search it''s sort of the wrong (954s)-framework I have no doubt that there (956s)-will be some things that people used to (958s)-do on Google that they do in touch EBT (960s)-but I think it''s a fundamentally (961s)-different kind of product Elon Musk (963s)-who''s an early investor in your company (965s)-he since left (967s)-um he has called out some of the chat (970s)-gbt inaccuracies and he tweeted recently (972s)-what we need is truth GPT is he right I (976s)-think he is right and that we want these (978s)-systems to tell the truth but I don''t (982s)-know the full context of that tweet and (984s)-I suspect but yeah I don''t think I know (987s)-what it''s referring to you when he speak (988s)-anymore we do and what does he say to (990s)-you off off the Twitter (994s)-um I have tremendous respect for Elon I (997s)-you know obviously we have some (998s)-different opinions about how (1000s)-AI should go but I think we (1002s)-fundamentally agree on more than we (1003s)-disagree on what do you think you agree (1005s)-most about (1006s)-that getting this technology right and (1009s)-figuring out how to navigate the risks (1012s)-is super important to the future of (1014s)-humanity how will you know if you got it (1017s)-right (1017s)-one simple way is if if most people (1020s)-think they''re much better off than they (1023s)-were before we put the technology out (1026s)-into the world that would be an (1027s)-indication we got it right you know a (1029s)-lot of people think science fiction yeah (1031s)-when they think chat GPT can you keep it (1034s)-so that these are truly closed systems (1037s)-that don''t become more powerful than we (1040s)-are as human beings communicate with (1041s)-each other and plan our destruction it''s (1044s)-so tempting to anthropomorphize Chachi (1047s)-Beauty but I think it''s important to (1048s)-talk about what it''s not as much as what (1050s)-it is (1051s)-and (1052s)-it because deep in our biology we are (1057s)-programmed to respond to someone talking (1060s)-to us (1061s)-you talk to chat GPT which you know (1063s)-really you''re talking to this (1064s)-Transformer (1065s)-somewhere in a cloud and it''s trying to (1067s)-predict the next word in a token and (1069s)-give it to you back (1070s)-but it''s so tempting to anthropomorphize (1073s)-that and think that this is like (1075s)-and and like a entity a sentient being (1078s)-that I''m talking to and it''s gonna go do (1081s)-its own thing and have its own will and (1083s)-you know plan with others but it can''t (1085s)-it can''t could it (1088s)-there I can imagine in the far future (1090s)-other versions of artificial (1092s)-intelligence different setups that are (1095s)-not a large language model that could do (1096s)-that it really took a decade plus of (1099s)-social media being out in the world for (1101s)-us to sort of realize and even (1103s)-characterize some of the real downsides (1106s)-of it how should we be measuring it here (1109s)-with AI (1110s)-there''s a number of new organizations (1112s)-starting and I expect relatively soon (1114s)-there will be new governmental (1115s)-departments or commissions or groups (1117s)-starting is the government prepared for (1119s)-this (1120s)-they are beginning to really pay (1122s)-attention which I think is great and I (1124s)-think this is another reason that''s (1125s)-important to put these Technologies out (1127s)-into the world we really need the (1129s)-government''s attention we really need (1131s)-thoughtful policy here and that takes a (1132s)-while to do (1135s)-right now to protect people and protect (1138s)-from the downside of this technology (1140s)-what should they do the main thing I (1142s)-would like to see the government do (1143s)-today is really come up to speed quickly (1146s)-on understanding what''s happening get (1148s)-insight into the top efforts where our (1151s)-capabilities are what we''re doing and I (1153s)-think that could start right now are you (1155s)-speaking to the government you''re in (1157s)-regular content regular contact and do (1159s)-you think they get it more and more (1161s)-every day when it comes to schools you (1165s)-have this this technology can beat most (1169s)-humans at the SATs the bar exam (1172s)-how should schools be integrating this (1174s)-technology in a way that doesn''t (1177s)-increase cheating that doesn''t increase (1179s)-laziness among students (1182s)-education is going to have to change but (1185s)-it''s happened many other times with (1186s)-technology when we got the calculator (1188s)-the way we taught math and what we (1189s)-tested students on that totally changed (1192s)-the (1194s)-the promise of this technology one of (1196s)-the ones that I''m most excited about is (1198s)-the ability to provide individual (1200s)-learning great individual learning for (1203s)-each student you''re already seeing (1205s)-students using chatgpt for this in a (1207s)-very primitive way to great success and (1209s)-as companies take our technology and (1212s)-create dedicated platforms for this kind (1214s)-of learning I think it will (1216s)-revolutionize education and I think that (1218s)-kids that are starting (1220s)-the education process today by the time (1222s)-they graduate from high school are going (1224s)-to be like smarter and more capable than (1225s)-we can imagine it''s a little better than (1227s)-a TI-85 it''s a little better uh but but (1230s)-it is it does (1232s)-put a lot of pressure on teachers (1235s)-to read for example if they''ve assigned (1238s)-an essay (1239s)-three of their students use chat GPT to (1241s)-write that essay how are they going to (1243s)-figure that out I''ve talked to a lot of (1245s)-teachers about this and it is true that (1247s)-it puts pressure in some ways but for an (1250s)-overworked teacher to be able to say hey (1252s)-go use chanchi PT to learn this

our first result (200s)-back so let''s take a closer look here so (203s)-you can see these were in the four five (205s)-format right wow this is amazing the (209s)-fingers are still messed up you can see (211s)-she has one extra finger here that''s a (214s)-bit funny but other than that look at (216s)-this (217s)-remember this is a 1930s female (221s)-influencer so the camera is probably (224s)-influenced by that (225s)-and I like that it''s an old camera (227s)-that''s great (229s)-and this looks very realistic right (232s)-also this pose here they''re all posing (235s)-for a camera I think (237s)-yeah this looks awesome very happy with (240s)-this so let''s take a look at something I (243s)-wanted to show you here so I just (245s)-created this quick photo list of photos (248s)-I want to do today so this is the 1930s (251s)-female influencer next I want to do (253s)-something with Vikings as you probably (255s)-saw in the thumbnail that was a viking (257s)-prompt so let''s just do that so I think (260s)-the first Viking prompt I want to do is (262s)-now generate a prompt of a (264s)-photorealistic portrait of a screaming (267s)-female viking so let''s try that (271s)-okay so that was the prompt let''s just (273s)-take a deeper look into our first prompt (276s)-I''m not gonna do this for everyone but (277s)-you can see a powerful vividly realistic (280s)-portrait of a fierce female Viking (283s)-Warrior mid Battle Cry her face (285s)-contorted with raw emotion and (287s)-determination as the fearlessly leads or (290s)-comrades into battle that''s a great (292s)-sentence right and you can see there''s (295s)-all that all of these camera settings (296s)-that we asked for we have the aperture (299s)-we have the lenses we have the iso we (302s)-have the shutter speed and it also adds (305s)-the aspect ratios the quality right that (309s)-is probably from our examples so I think (311s)-that''s very important too the Shadow the (314s)-shallow depth of field skillfully (316s)-isolates the Warrior from the chaotic (318s)-Battlefield in the background wow I''m (320s)-excited for this prompt so you can see (322s)-I''m leaving out V5 because that''s (324s)-automatic so I''m gonna copy all of this (326s)-and head over to Mid Journey wow this is (330s)-insane look look at this this is crazy (334s)-so where was this wow look at this (337s)-uh I might remember my camera is in the (339s)-way let me move this (341s)-this is insane look at the intensity in (344s)-the eyes and look at the details (346s)-oh my God look at this (349s)-I''m kind of scared looking at it damn (351s)-that''s impressive (354s)-I''ve got a speechless right now (357s)-this was (360s)-I didn''t expect this kind of quality (363s)-amazing but we gotta move on so let''s (366s)-head over to our next photo so now I (369s)-wanted to do a photo a prompt of the (373s)-perfect pasta dish so let me just run (375s)-that (378s)-okay so here we have the prompt I just (380s)-wanted to point point out one thing so (382s)-you can see we don''t mention anything of (384s)-a photo here but it still understands (387s)-from the examples I gave it with the (388s)-priming right that it should be a (390s)-photograph and it also picks the camera (392s)-aperture lenses shutter speed and (395s)-everything we need in a photo so that is (397s)-very good so let''s just go ahead and run (400s)-this okay so here we have it here is our (403s)-pasta dish and damn that looks good I (406s)-gotta say that looks very gummy so let''s (408s)-just blow that up look at the details (410s)-here you can see the Tomato you can see (412s)-the parmesan (414s)-I can''t really not understand that this (417s)-can (418s)-this has to be able to replace some kind (421s)-of food photograph photography isn''t (424s)-that really expensive to hire people to (426s)-capture food (428s)-so what if you just didn''t you just took (430s)-an image of your food on your restaurant (432s)-and fed this into the image to image and (435s)-then you get like an expanded or better (437s)-version of it look at the details here (440s)-it''s just crazy (441s)-with the flower or what it is on the (444s)-side here (445s)-you can see some kind of Parmesan has (447s)-fell off the plate (449s)-I''m just amazed by this (451s)-this is just insane this is I have to (454s)-say this looks really Next Level (456s)-very impressive (459s)-so what I thought we can do now instead (461s)-of me going through each prompt what I''m (463s)-gonna do now is just I''m gonna go to my (466s)-photo list here hope you can see this (469s)-and I''m just going to collect a whole (472s)-lot of different prompts but before I do (474s)-that I just wanted to show you one more (476s)-thing and that is uh I want to show you (478s)-as something I tried that worked pretty (481s)-well and that is changing up the input (483s)-prompt here to now generate a prompt of (486s)-your interpretation off and then you (488s)-just add something at the end here I''m (490s)-just gonna run that and I''m gonna (492s)-collect a whole lot of prompts from this (494s)-list and didn''t be just gonna look at (496s)-all of them in mid Journey okay so now (499s)-we have every single image I wanted to (501s)-collect so let''s just go over them one (503s)-by one so the first one we have is the (506s)-prompt was a viking shape sharpening his (509s)-blade so let''s take a look at this look (512s)-how realistic this is this is just (514s)-amazing I kind of can''t get over how (517s)-good the hair looks right that''s just it (520s)-looks perfect I guess the weapon and the (522s)-blades are a bit strange (524s)-but it''s so realistic look the headband (527s)-here is a bit off but other than that (529s)-and look at the background is blurry (532s)-this is just again look at that hair (534s)-that scar might be a bit off but look at (537s)-that hair how good it looks the fur is (539s)-amazing I''m just shocked how good is (542s)-this the fingers at least it has four (545s)-fingers but the skin looks a bit but I (547s)-kinda impressed by this wow it''s gonna (550s)-be a lot of fun playing around with this (552s)-okay so let''s move on to our next image (555s)-and that is going to be a a gladiator (557s)-hunting in the forest so let''s blow this (561s)-up again you can see it''s a bit off uh I (565s)-kind of like the ground here but the (566s)-face is kind of messed up uh this was (569s)-quite cool but the sword again it''s (571s)-messed up the shield has a blade but I (574s)-like the forest that''s good this may be (576s)-a bit off again that looks good The (578s)-Shield is maybe a bit off and there''s (580s)-something wrong on his head so it''s not (582s)-perfect but quite good I think this is (585s)-the best one uh it''s black and white (587s)-though but if it wasn''t for that bug (589s)-with the blade I think this will be (591s)-perfect kind of weird with the hat and (593s)-stuff so if I wanted the perfect image (595s)-of this I kind of had to do some reruns (597s)-I think (598s)-okay so let''s have a look at the next (600s)-one this is a good one this is a perfect (603s)-moment when a bee lands on a flower and (607s)-look at these details what can I say (609s)-look at the pollen here and look at the (611s)-details inside the beast''s eyes here and (615s)-the pollen and the fur you can really (617s)-see the fur here that''s just I can''t (620s)-really believe this is AI generated look (623s)-how good the fur looks here this is a (626s)-pure macro photo oh that''s good I can''t (629s)-believe how good the fur looks amazing (632s)-okay let''s move on and this was that GPT (637s)-Force interpretation of dreaming so (640s)-let''s blow it up I gotta say I really (642s)-like this it''s just so wholesome it''s so (646s)-peaceful there''s one one quite gross (648s)-thing here just three feet so let''s just (651s)-move on from that but look at this one (653s)-look how peaceful this is this too the (656s)-hands are a bit weird and there''s (658s)-something here but this I gotta say was (660s)-my favorite that''s just great remember (662s)-this was just the prompt was give me (664s)-your interpretation of dreaming right (667s)-okay so this was a good one this was (670s)-your interpretation of artificial (673s)-intelligence ruling over humans this (676s)-image is cool right there''s like a big (678s)-army of is it humans or is it AIS I (681s)-think it''s AIS or some robots (684s)-this was great (685s)-this looks like from a movie right you (688s)-see that this one is guarding over all (690s)-these humans here this was quite cool I (692s)-guess there are humans in the background (694s)-it''s a bit strange but I like the cyborg (697s)-robot here this is also very it''s a bit (700s)-creepy (702s)-but still this I just did this image I (705s)-didn''t redo any so that''s cool okay so (708s)-move on to this was a 19th 1950s female (712s)-police officer so let''s blow this up (715s)-perfect how good is this (718s)-you can see the eye is a bit off maybe (720s)-other than that there''s really nothing (723s)-to there''s no flaws here is it I can''t (726s)-really see any else (728s)-anything else that''s flawed here the (730s)-lips are perfect the eyes are good just (732s)-looking that way the hat is very good of (735s)-course the text over here is a bit messy (738s)-but yeah this is awesome okay so let''s (741s)-check our next prompt this was a (743s)-mysterious cabin in by the Fjord in (747s)-Norway (748s)-so I can kind of relate to this (751s)-I think this one was the best one (754s)-uh (755s)-because this is usually the style of (758s)-cabins we have here (759s)-so let me take a look at this one yeah (762s)-this two is quite good it''s not a (764s)-typical Fjord setup I guess it kinda is (767s)-still but disc cabins are rarely seen (770s)-this but it''s still good I like that (773s)-three zero green but on the other side (775s)-they are snowy that''s a bit strange (778s)-Maybe (779s)-this one is good the wall is a bit (781s)-strange but other than that perfect the (784s)-mountains just exactly as we have it (787s)-here and I like the reflection right the (789s)-reflection is perfect down in the water (791s)-on all images that''s very good nice okay (796s)-so this was (797s)-um (797s)-Star Wars inspired living room interior (801s)-remember I did a video on this with me (803s)-Journey 4. uh I don''t know if this is (806s)-improved I think there are more details (808s)-here and it look it looks great just (811s)-think of how many Architects or interior (814s)-designers can take advantage of this now (816s)-I know I''ve done a few videos on this (818s)-but (819s)-look at this (820s)-this was just the only prompt I ran and (823s)-it''s just awesome (825s)-crazy okay so the final one we have on (829s)-this video is an Iron Man inspired (832s)-sports car let''s blow this up (835s)-I like the one in the right corner here (838s)-the colors are spot on (841s)-the on the left top corner too that''s (843s)-very good I think I read somewhere that (846s)-um (847s)-some car designers now are using AI to (850s)-get the inspiration (852s)-and you can kind of see why because you (855s)-can create hundreds of this just to get (857s)-some inspiration wow crazy this was a (860s)-bit strange that the headlights are in (862s)-the back and the front (864s)-that''s a bit strange other than that I (867s)-think this one was the coolest awesome (869s)-so just a quick word on my first (872s)-impression of mid Journey five uh I (874s)-gotta say I''m really impressed I can''t (876s)-get over have good dose I think my (879s)-favorite images has to be the Viking (882s)-girl I can''t get over how good this (884s)-looks (885s)-it''s so realistic (888s)-it''s almost scary I guess the tongue (890s)-here is a bit of but yeah my first (892s)-impression is very good and I can''t wait (894s)-to get around to play more with it and I (897s)-think combining this with gpd4 can get (900s)-you some really good prompts so I (902s)-suggest you try it out so like I said in (905s)-the middle of the video if you want the (907s)-prompts I use the prime gpt4 just sign (909s)-up for my newsletter you can also check (911s)-out my membership in the description (913s)-below also check out this video here if (916s)-you enjoyed this one I think you''re (918s)-gonna like that and as always thank you (920s)-for tuning in have a great day and I''ll (922s)-see you in the next one ", "start":

the (8s)-chapter that I considered the darkest (9s)-wasn''t the one on the coming breakup of (11s)-the European Union or Wars that would (13s)-happen in China it was literally called (15s)-the North American Drug War of all of (17s)-the issues out in the International (18s)-System and this includes the (20s)-disintegration of China and what''s going (22s)-on in Ukraine it is our relationship (24s)-with Mexico that was going to determine (27s)-the health the wealth and the security (29s)-of the American citizens moving forward (31s)-for decades Mexico is our number one (33s)-trading partner and it is also the (36s)-vector by which we absorb cocaine into (38s)-this country so we have set up a (40s)-situation where all of our interests (42s)-Allied and are being dealt with in a (44s)-very very bad manner not just by this (46s)-Administration but by the previous one (48s)-and the one before that and the one (49s)-before that and the one before that this (51s)-is not a new problem (53s)-okay so economics of drugs it''s (56s)-obviously about the cocaine I mean it''s (59s)-like you can put a half a million (60s)-dollars of product in your backpack of (61s)-course it''s about the cocaine and (63s)-because it has a very high value to cost (65s)-it is very easy to smuggle uh and so it (69s)-doesn''t really matter if you have a wall (70s)-uh because somebody with a backpack will (72s)-just hop it and make you know make (74s)-themselves very very wealthy very very (75s)-quickly but once you get cocaine you (78s)-then are left for the big Fistful of (79s)-cash and you can''t exactly put it in the (81s)-Local Credit Union so what happens is (84s)-the cartels try to get into businesses (86s)-where there''s a fair amount of cash that (88s)-flows through them so agricultural (90s)-harvesting or processing are relatively (94s)-popular as are things like real estate (98s)-and rental properties they''re big fans (100s)-of bars uh what they do is they try to (103s)-get a facility that has a lot of cash (104s)-flow through and then they just feed (106s)-some of their drug profits through it (108s)-and report it as income and that it can (110s)-get laundered and into the financial (112s)-system at Large and in Mexico Indy in (115s)-the United States this has brought them (117s)-into things like avocado and line (119s)-production this has brought them into (121s)-tourism uh this has brought them into (123s)-real estate rentals uh up to and (126s)-including just like you know residential (128s)-real estate multi-family housing (130s)-uh the more you do this in a community (132s)-the more you start distorting the Local (136s)-Economic environment and that means you (138s)-have to put another layer into it and (139s)-you have to get into the political Elite (141s)-and that means going into universities (143s)-uh going into institutions going to the (145s)-local government and buying them off so (147s)-that the tax man doesn''t look too close (149s)-at the books and this is how you kind of (152s)-hollow out systems from the inside and (154s)-this is one of the things that Sinaloa (156s)-under El Chapo started to do in places (158s)-like rural Texas because it allowed him (161s)-to get a foothold north of the Border (163s)-South of the Border there is not a a (166s)-city in which this has not happened to (169s)-some degree but it''s really really (170s)-popular in agricultural regions and (173s)-places where tourism is really strong (175s)-like in the Yucatan Peninsula or in Cabo (178s)-now once a cartel reaches a certain (180s)-point they have enough resources they (182s)-can reach up and down the supply chain (184s)-if you go north into the United States (187s)-you go on and you start interfacing with

(229s)-solution here is very very simple don''t (232s)-do cocaine one more thing I live in (235s)-Colorado and one of the things that (237s)-Colorado has discovered in recent years (239s)-is that they had a problem with (242s)-processing the profits so it used to be (247s)-that in Colorado you would basically (250s)-have a giant walk-in safe because you (251s)-couldn''t put your money in the bank you (253s)-couldn''t put in a credit union which (255s)-meant that everybody had all this cash (257s)-lined around and these dispensaries were (259s)-paying for everything in cash well the (261s)-Federal Reserve was like whoa whoa whoa (263s)-that''s a crime issue so what we''re gonna (265s)-do is we''re going to send armored trucks (267s)-to all of these dispensaries we''re gonna (268s)-pick up the cash where to bring it out (270s)-we''re going to iron it out and Febreze (271s)-the crap out of it so it doesn''t smell (272s)-like pot anymore and then we''re going to (274s)-make an electronic deposit into your (276s)-account on behalf of the Federal Reserve (278s)-so no must no fuss well the Sinaloa (281s)-hears about this let me get this (283s)-straight (285s)-the U.S federal reserve is now in the (287s)-business of laundering drug money sign (290s)-us up and so there''s a lot of this (293s)-cannabis supply chain in Colorado that (295s)-has been bought up on all

open source project then you (41s)-have tons of closed Source projects like (42s)-Dolly from open Ai and countless others (45s)-trying to monetize the space but in my (47s)-opinion mid-journey is the most (48s)-impressive place to prove the images (50s)-just pop they''re vibrant realistic and (52s)-aesthetically pleasing for that we (53s)-shouldn''t be thanking mid-journey but (55s)-all the

(87s)-but then transitioned to for-profit when (89s)-they realized how much mother F and (91s)-money they were going to make on this (92s)-thing in any case I''m happy to pay 10 (93s)-bucks a month for co-pilot 20 bucks a (95s)-month for chat GPT and 10 bucks a month (97s)-for mid-journing together they put (98s)-almost all of human creativity at your (100s)-fingertips making you a demigod in the (102s)-digital world at the same time it will (103s)-likely ruin creativity because who wants (105s)-to create art when you know some (106s)-company''s just going to steal it and (108s)-remix it

flag at the end of your (156s)-prompt to get highly realistic images of (158s)-humans I would also recommend adding the (159s)-Q flag as 2 to increase the quality (162s)-there''s all kinds of different (162s)-parameters you can use to change the (164s)-output some of the most useful ones (166s)-include aspect ratio do change the shape (168s)-of the image and chaos to control the (170s)-amount of craziness the higher the chaos (172s)-the more random stuff you might get in (174s)-the output image what''s especially (175s)-awesome though is that you can also (176s)-provide a

supposed to get this cheap this (52s)-fast just six weeks ago or five weeks (55s)-before they released the model Arc (57s)-Investment Management put out this (59s)-prediction that the 2020 cost of GPT

has happened within (77s)-five weeks of this prediction being (80s)-published not eight years as AI (83s)-researcher Elie Isa yudkowski puts it I (86s)-don''t think people realize what a big (88s)-deal it is that Stanford retrained a (90s)-llama model by cheaply fine-tuning it (93s)-now I''m going to explain all of this in (94s)-a moment it then goes on I''m not sure I (96s)-can convey how much this is a brand new (99s)-idiom of AI as a technology now Stanford (102s)-claimed their model performs comparably (104s)-to DaVinci 3 which is GPT 3.5 of course (108s)-I''m going to test and analyze this in a (110s)-moment but how could it be that a 600 (112s)-model can compete with chat gbt well do (116s)-you remember how meta open sourced their (118s)-llama models about two weeks ago (120s)-Stanford used the weakest of these open (123s)-source models these seven billion (125s)-parameter one and then essentially they (127s)-recruited GPT 3.5 to train that meta (132s)-model how could they possibly do this (134s)-well they used self-instruct and I dug (137s)-into the literature to find the original (139s)-paper on self-instruct this was released (142s)-in December of last year and I''m going (144s)-to give you the 30 second summary of how (146s)-it works essentially you start off with (148s)-some human-made examples of Exemplar (151s)-prompts and outputs these are fed into (154s)-the language model and then you ask it (156s)-to generate thousands more such (158s)-instances you filter out the bad ones (160s)-and then put all the good examples back (163s)-into the language model then it (164s)-understands the instructions much better (166s)-and produces thousands more examples as (168s)-the paper says this is Almost Human (171s)-annotation free and remember this stat (173s)-it only leaves a five percent Gap behind (176s)-instruct GPT what is instruct gbt well (180s)-it''s the Breakthrough that led to chat (182s)-GPT in the first place look at the (185s)-original gpt3 if you gave a prompt like (187s)-explain the moon landing to a (189s)-six-year-old in a few sentences you''ve (190s)-got this gobbledygook here after months (193s)-of onerous human training called (195s)-reinforcement learning with human (196s)-feedback he was able to follow (198s)-instructions much better and produce an (201s)-outcome like this but this relied on so (204s)-much human labeling and human ranking of (206s)-outputs from best to worst Stanford and (209s)-the self-instruct breakthroughs showed (210s)-that you could cut all of those costs so (212s)-in summary they used an open source meta (215s)-model and got GPT 3.5 to train it one (219s)-Advanced model teaching another as (221s)-yudkowski points out these models have (223s)-enough pseudo-intelligence that they can (225s)-stare at other models and imitate them (228s)-indeed openai may have even predicted (230s)-that this was possible in their terms of (232s)-service it says you may not use output (235s)-from the services like Chachi BT to (238s)-develop models that compete with openai (240s)-so they knew it was possible and even (242s)-Stanford admit that this breakthrough (244s)-enables more people including Bad actors (246s)-to create new cheap models yutkowski (250s)-also points out that one of the reasons (251s)-reasons why chat GPT and gpd4 are so (254s)-good is that they rest on proprietary (256s)-data and that that was supposed to give (258s)-them a competitive moat which is now (261s)-revealed people can quite cheaply steal (263s)-just before I test and demonstrate our (266s)-packer in action let me summarize how it (268s)-works using the self-instruct process (270s)-you get GPT 3.5 similar to chat gbt to (274s)-create thousands and thousands in this (276s)-case 52 000 instruction following (279s)-examples automatically filtered by (281s)-quality Stanford then used an open (284s)-source model indeed the weakest of the (286s)-Llama models and trained it using those (289s)-examples the end result alpaca so let''s (292s)-see in action and compare it to Chachi (294s)-PT and gbt4 oh and just quickly you know (297s)-that training of the Llama model with (299s)-those 52 000 examples it only took three (301s)-hours and cost less than a hundred (303s)-dollars the first example I''m going to (305s)-show you does not come from me I found (307s)-it in this academic paper Linked In the (309s)-description and it''s a task which (311s)-requires understanding detailed and (314s)-dissonant scenarios applying appropriate (316s)-legal precedence and choosing the (318s)-correct explanation the correct answer (320s)-if you want to read through it or not is (322s)-B alpaca gets this question right or I (325s)-should say it gets it right about 80 of (327s)-the time you can keep clicking generate (328s)-and sometimes you do get the answer D (330s)-but about 80 of the time four times in (333s)-five you get the correct answer B how (335s)-about chatty BT well every time I''ve (337s)-tried it it''s gotten the wrong answer of (339s)-c and gpt4 shocking even to me it also (343s)-gets it wrong and picks C now before you (345s)-get too excited I am not saying that it (348s)-is better than or even as good as gbc4 (351s)-or chat GPT it''s not but remember it''s (354s)-only 7 billion parameters and 600 worth (357s)-take this example I asked it for an (360s)-example of an animal that begins with (361s)-the same letter as the capital city of (363s)-France and it said elephant no idea (365s)-where it got that now In fairness (367s)-chapter BT gave me lion and gbc4 gave me (371s)-ferret but there are other questions (373s)-where alpaca definitely flops for (375s)-example this math question which Chach (377s)-BT and gbt4 uniformly get right alpaca (381s)-simply gets it wrong every time I tried (384s)-asking it in lots of different ways with (385s)-Chain of Thought prompting but no every (388s)-time it gets it wrong it''s definitely (390s)-not better than those models but by the (392s)-end of the video you''ll see why it''s (393s)-revolutionary anyway at this point if (395s)-you''re learning anything please don''t (397s)-forget to leave a like or a comment to (399s)-let me know basic addition and (400s)-subtraction it does better and yes it (403s)-can crank out poems solve some hella (405s)-swag Common Sense problems and generate (408s)-literary analogies but at this point I (410s)-want to remind you of three things first (413s)-that it was using the weakest of the (415s)-Llama open source models they could have (418s)-used these 65 billion parameter model (420s)-for a bit more cost I''m sure the results (422s)-would have been even more impressive (424s)-next you remember it was trained by (426s)-examples generated using the DaVinci 3 (429s)-Model well that cost them about 0 0.03 (432s)-dollars per 1000 tokens but as 48 hours (436s)-ago they could have used the gpt4 API at (440s)-a very similar cost so it wasn''t the (443s)-best open source model and it wasn''t (444s)-trained by the best GPT model I am (447s)-genuinely curious as to what the results (449s)-would have been if it had been trained (451s)-by the 65 billion parameter model using (453s)-a gpt4 API maybe someone''s going to do (456s)-that maybe even this week but just (458s)-before we get on to Apple Amazon Britain (460s)-and Baidu I just want to restate this (462s)-was all done for 600 or less they even (466s)-say there were training efficiencies (468s)-they could have done for example using (469s)-the h100 gpus that would have further (471s)-reduced the cost the question is if it''s (473s)-so easy and cheap to imitate a larger (476s)-model what''s going to happen when Apple (478s)-released their large language model it (480s)-was only revealed yesterday in the New (482s)-York Times that they are indeed working (484s)-on one and don''t forget they have far (486s)-more money than the other companies (488s)-mentioned Amazon recently stated that (490s)-they have been working on similar Tech (492s)-to chat gbt for a long time and looking (496s)-in the literature as early as mid last (498s)-year they had a model called Alexa TM (501s)-that outperformed gpt3 and as you may (504s)-already know but I do demonstrated their (507s)-Ernie bot today although they didn''t (509s)-allow anyone else to use it apparently (511s)-it''s better in the Chinese language than (513s)-even gpt4 but because they didn''t (515s)-release a paper and we can''t check it we (517s)-simply don''t know and of course we can''t (519s)-forget Google who just two days ago (521s)-announced the Palm API what would have (524s)-happened if Stanford''s model had used (526s)-that one I''m sure we will soon find out (529s)-but to take us back to the start I have (531s)-one overriding observation and two (533s)-questions first these models weren''t (536s)-supposed to get this cheap this fast (538s)-that is going to upend the economics of (541s)-large language models my questions are (543s)-these does this mean that all incentive (546s)-is gone for Microsoft or Google to pour (549s)-in billions of dollars producing these (551s)-Cutting Edge models if anyone can just (553s)-easily reproduce them will they react by (556s)-making the models even more closed and (558s)-disallowing gpt5 from having an API we (561s)-don''t know but as even Nation States (563s)-enter this quote-unquote arms race (566s)-spending hundreds of millions of pounds (568s)-in this case to build great GPT are (571s)-these companies and governments drifting (574s)-into a war on two fronts where they (576s)-compete with each other but also with (578s)-Outsiders who are trying to cheaply (581s)-imitate their models if you''ve learned (583s)-anything in this video please do leave a (585s)-like and leave a comment but either way (587s)-have a wonderful day ", "start": 0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 589}]}', '{}',

it''s not worth an infinite price so (394s)-we have to have a price that makes sense (397s)-and gives a margin of safety considering (402s)-the natural vicissitudes of life that''s (404s)-a very simple set of ideas and the (408s)-reason that our ideas have not spread (410s)-faster is they''re too simple the (413s)-professional classes can''t justify their (418s)-existence if that''s all I have to say (420s)-it''s all so obvious and so simple what (424s)-would they have to do with the rest of (425s)-the semester (430s)-well at the time we bought it it was (437s)-succeeding mightily on multiple fronts (441s)-and it was cheap in relation to what was (447s)-plainly going to happen that was a (451s)-valuable insight there are times when (455s)-even a company as big as coca-cola is to (457s)-cheaply priced by the market considering (460s)-what it''s going to do for the (461s)-shareholder and there are times when we (464s)-can figure that out and there are times (466s)-when we can''t and the times when we can (469s)-figure it out we tend to go in heavily (472s)-for many many months we were buying as (476s)-much coca-cola as we could buy roughly a (480s)-third of the volume trading every day (483s)-for months so we were very aggressive in (488s)-buying into coca-cola (492s)-we have the mindset of the person that''s (495s)-buying the whole business at the price (500s)-you would realize by multiplying the (502s)-price we''re paying by share by the (504s)-number of outstanding shares and and we (508s)-want the price for the whole business so (512s)-calculated to look very attractive so we (517s)-like buying individual shares at a price (519s)-that''s lower than we think a rational (522s)-person would pay if he could buy the (523s)-whole business (529s)-born would have been a huge success of (531s)-charlie munger never lived how often do (534s)-you speak to him well in the early days (537s)-it was almost every day and now it''s (540s)-maybe once a week only once a week yeah (543s)-not very much but sometimes it''s a long (546s)-conversation you and Warren are very (551s)-much a double act in the chairman and (554s)-vice-chairman of the company at some (555s)-point you want to probably retire and (558s)-shoot step down rest a bit well I don''t (562s)-think either of us wants to quit except (565s)-as the laws of physiology force it and (570s)-that no doubt will be soon on us but you (578s)-got to remember that Berkshire is (581s)-probably the most decentralized big (585s)-corporation in the world (586s)-I think the very decentralization of (589s)-Berkshire and the extreme pockets of (592s)-talent in all the subsidiaries will give (595s)-Berkshire a very respectable future long (598s)-after we''re gone and you''ve got to (602s)-remember that we started a little (605s)-nothing and our successors are starting (611s)-with something that is not a little (613s)-nothing and you ought to be able to (618s)-achieve a lot more when you''re given a (623s)-mighty hand then you were when you start (627s)-with a little nothing they won''t be able (629s)-to multiply money as fast per share (632s)-because that can''t happen when you''re (634s)-working with such large sums but in (637s)-terms of a creditable institution that (640s)-serves the wider world (642s)-I think Berkshires contribution after (650s)-Warren is dead will utterly

"(0s)-i really liked omaha it was a size where (7s)-i knew a lot of the people who mattered and what \nthey did so i wasn''t lost in a great metropolis   (14s)-and i was very fortunate in my nature of my \nparents my parents friends and i was fortunate   (23s)-in the public schools i attended were pretty \nremarkable by the standards of the time and (32s)-of course most of my schooling was in the great \ndepression but that means i''m one of the very few   (39s)-people that''s still alive who deeply remembers \nthe great depression and that that''s been very   (45s)-helpful to me it was so extreme that people like \nyou have just no idea what the hell it was like   (52s)-and it was really there was just nobody had \nany money the rich people didn''t have any money   (58s)-people would come and beg for a meal at the \ndoor and we had a hobo jungle not very far   (64s)-from my grandfather''s house and i was forbidden \nto walk through it which meant i walked through   (70s)-it all the time and i was safer in that hobo \njungle in the depths of the 30s when people were   (76s)-starving practically that i am walking around \nmy own neighborhood now in los angeles at night   (82s)-the world has changed on that you''d \nthink the crime would be less but   (88s)-it was the crime was pretty low in those days \nso anyway so i had a very unusual bunch of   (95s)-experience to be to go through civilization in \nvarious phases including the greatest recession   (103s)-well i say it''s one of the greatest recessions \nin 600 years in the english-speaking world   (109s)-it was really something and it \nwas very interesting to watch   (114s)-and and also to watch it fixed it was fixed \nby the accidental keynesianism of world war ii (124s)-very interesting and hitler had fixed the great \ndepression in in germany by the deliberate   (133s)-keynesianism but he wasn''t doing it to \nstimulate the economy he wanted to get even   (138s)-with all the people he hated but he borrowed all \nthis money and created all these armaments and (148s)-hitler''s germany by 1939 was the strongest \neconomic power in europe and nobody else was close   (155s)-so and you wouldn''t understand that as well as i \ndo if you hadn''t lived through it you just didn''t   (161s)-see the place gaining traction more and more \nand more and more and pretty soon it was fixed   (168s)-and and and of course that was in those days \nthere were all kinds of people most of my   (176s)-family they believed in hard money based on gold \nand not much welfare and so on and so on so that   (182s)-i was raised among fairly backward people by \nmodern standards but they were backward in kind   (187s)-of a self-reliant way that i think was helpful \ni''ve never regretted that i wasn''t raised in a   (195s)-more liberal establishment i had a liberal aunt \nshe was really my mother''s cousin but she i was   (202s)-and she was the first second lady dean at the \nuniversity of chicago and she done her thesis   (208s)-on the conditions in the coal mines and of \ncourse she was a screaming leftist i would   (213s)-be a streaming leftist if i observed the way \nthe coal miners of yesteryear were treated   (218s)-you couldn''t be a human being with any decency in \nyou without feeling it was deeply improper to have   (226s)-the misery that great and have it manipulated \nfor the benefit of the mind owners and so forth   (232s)-but she sent me all these left wing \nbangs books one every christmas   (237s)-and i always thought she was a little nuts (243s)-which shows that if sometimes a very vivid \nextreme ex you know evidence misleads you   (250s)-on the deeper reality you''ve got to be a \nguard on that against that all your life   (256s)-in fact the whole trick in life is to get \nso that your own brain doesn''t mislead you   (261s)-and and i have found that just a lifelong fun \ngame and i can''t remember a time i wasn''t doing it   (271s)-i was not a prodigy or anything like that but i \nwas i was a prodigy in having adult interests i   (280s)-was interested in what worked and what didn''t and \nwhy and i could see that very imminent people that   (286s)-i loved and revered were nuts in some ways and i \nwould decide well i certainly like dr davis but   (293s)-he''s a little nutty in one way and i''m not going \nto be that like that and so it was very judgmental   (299s)-and i think that helped me and also helped \nme that i kept changing my judgments as   (306s)-i learned more and more facts came in and \nthat created lifelong habits that were very   (313s)-very useful another thing i think really helped me \nis particularly on my father''s side of the family (322s)-my paternal grandfather was the only federal judge \nin lincoln nebraska the capital city of nebraska   (329s)-and he''d been there forever and he stayed \nthere forever after that i think when he   (334s)-left he was the longest-serving federal judge \nin the country and he was a brilliant man and   (341s)-he''d risen from nothing he was the child of \ntwo impoverished school teachers and when he   (349s)-was raised in the little town of nebraska they''d \ngive him a nickel to go buy the meat and he''d go   (356s)-to the butcher shop and he would buy the \nparts of the animal nobody else would eat   (361s)-and that''s what two schoolteachers lived on in \nthose days and the very indignity of it bothered   (367s)-him so much that he he he just determined to get \nout of poverty and and never go back and he did   (376s)-he got ahead like abe lincoln educated himself in \nlawyer''s offices and so on he had to leave college   (383s)-because he couldn''t pay the tuition anymore \nand but he educated himself and since he was   (389s)-utterly brilliant it wasn''t all that hard and \nhe had an attitude it was pretty damned extreme   (398s)-and i would say his attitude was that you have a \nmoral duty to make yourself as unignorant and as   (406s)-unstupid as you possibly can and that it was your \npretty much your highest moral duty maybe taking   (412s)-care of your family came first but but in the \nranks of moral obligations quasi-related well   (419s)-he was conventionally religious so it may have \nbeen a religious duty to him but he he really   (424s)-believed that that rationality was a moral duty \nand he worked at it and he scorned people who''d   (433s)-who didn''t do it on the other hand as a judge \nhe started with the idea that why would anybody   (440s)-rob a train or whatever federal crime in those \ndays and he was pretty hard on people who did   (446s)-it and i noticed as he got to older and older and \nolder he was willing to call a man a good man on   (452s)-easier terms than he started out with and i think \nthat was a correct a correct development in my   (461s)-by the way when he relaxed a \nlittle he was still pretty tough   (466s)-but he he did relax a little \nwhich i thought was appropriate   (470s)-and but it was influenced by such people \nand when the 30s came one son-in-law (480s)-was a musician and of course he couldn''t make a \nliving so my grandfather didn''t have that much   (485s)-money sent him to pharmacy school carefully \npicking a profession that couldn''t fail and   (490s)-found him a bankrupt pharmacy to buy and loan \nhim the money and my uncle was soon prosperous   (496s)-and remain prosperous the rest of his life my \nother uncle had a bank in stromsburg nebraska   (503s)-but there were 968 people in stroudsburg \nand there were two national banks   (508s)-and the capitalization of my uncle''s bank \nwas 25 000 and of course he was a lovely man   (517s)-but he was an optimist and a \nbanker should not be an optimist   (523s)-and when they closed the banks in 1933 the \nbanking examiners came in and they said   (529s)-you can''t reopen and it was the only business he \nhad well judge monger had always saved his money   (536s)-and he had a lot of good first mortgages on homes \noccupied by t-totaling german butchers and people   (544s)-he''d carefully pitched and of course he never had \na default houses were in the right neighborhood   (549s)-the people were sober and hardworking and so what \nmy grandfather did is take a third of his good   (557s)-mortgages which is all he had put him into the \nbank and took all the lousy assets out of the bank   (563s)-so he saved two out of three of his \nof his children and i thought it was a   (571s)-pretty good thing to do and very sure the \nway he did it and he actually got most of   (577s)-his money back 10 or 15 years later out of \nthe lossy assets of the bank when world war   (583s)-ii and that was a good lesson on the other \nside my grandfather on the other side his   (591s)-main business had gone broke in 1922 with all the \nother wholesale dry goods houses and what he did   (601s)-his son-in-law one of them went broke and he \ncut his house in half and moved that family   (605s)-in and the other family the guy was an honors \ngraduate of the harvard school of architecture   (611s)-and he was very prosperous in the 20s in omaha \nand had a wonderful life and the 30s came the   (618s)-total building permits in omaha would sometimes be \n25 000 a month and that was for furnace repairs or   (624s)-something there was just no work none zero so he \nmoved to california and he lived for several years   (632s)-and he got finally he got the county of los \nangeles to hire this great harvard architect   (637s)-and his he got 108.08 a month after deductions and (645s)-they had him do drafting work but they \nclassified him as a laundromat to save money   (651s)-and he could actually rent a house for \n25 and feed himself and drive an old car   (655s)-but he could live on 109 a month amazing how \npoor everybody was and what happened to that   (663s)-grandfather is along came the fha and they had a \ncompetitive civil service examination and he was   (668s)-a very brilliant man of course he was first in \nthe exam and that made him the chief architect   (671s)-for the fha in los angeles where he spent the \nrest of his life but i watched all this family   (678s)-coping with all this difficulty and i''ll say this \nit sounds awful but they weren''t all that unhappy   (686s)-you can cope pretty well because you get used to \nit that''s a nice thing about the human condition   (693s)-and when you get to be my age you''ve got \na lot of horrible things to get used to   (699s)-it''s just one new indignity all the \ntime a friend of mine says a good day   (705s)-when you''re old is when you wake up \nin the morning and nothing new hurts   (712s)-so anyway that''s my experience in omaha but that \nbackground of these all these people were educated   (718s)-and civilized and generous and decent and a lot of \nthem had good senses of humor and it was a pretty   (727s)-damn good place to grow up in and my memory is of \nbeing surrounded by a lot of very fine people and   (738s)-i i think the whole thing was privileged i look \nat my background is absolutely privileged i''m   (744s)-proud of being an omaha boy i sometimes use the \nold saying they got the boy out of omaha but   (750s)-they never got them all out of the boy and and so \nall those old-fashioned values family comes first   (760s)-be in a position so you can help others when \ntroubles come prudent sensible moral duty to   (767s)-be reasonable more important than anything else \nmore important than being rich more important than   (772s)-being important an absolute moral duty \nbecause none of my intelligent relatives   (780s)-suffered terribly because they didn''t advance \nhigher right yeah i mean one of the things i''m   (785s)-fascinated by is um i mean this was in the 20s \nand 30s and the level of detail that you recall   (790s)-about their experiences and how that''s shaping \nyour experiences now i''m trying to give people a   (795s)-flavor of something that nobody else can remember \nyeah i mean you''re you''re you''re a student of   (801s)-the people that you''re that you''re experiencing \nso so you grow up in omaha nebraska um you find   (807s)-yourself in ann arbor michigan how does that \nhappen very simple i wanted to go to stanford (817s)-and my father said to me charlie i was the only \nson two two sisters he says i''ve got two daughters   (824s)-to educate right after you i don''t have unlimited \nmoney he says i will send you this stanford if   (830s)-it really means a great deal to you but i''d \nrather you pick a university in the midwest   (836s)-much better than mine which was the university \nof nebraska and that was obviously going to be   (840s)-michigan what was i going to say well screw you \nand send me to stanford oh i didn''t say that   (846s)-i went to michigan so you come to michigan \ni have never regretted that at all i loved (858s)-at stanford people came to stanford in the 30s \nwith their string of polo ponies and it was a   (867s)-very upscale fraternity sorority culture i used to \ncall it the co-educational princeton of the west   (876s)-and and people loved it and so forth but literally \nyou''d go to stanford with a string of polo ponies   (884s)-i should say i''m bringing back to you young people \na time you can''t remember who did you ever know   (891s)-in college that came with a string of polo phones \nnot very many people now they go they''d be in the   (897s)-rotc but they have their own string of polo ponies \nyou could win better if you have your own string   (905s)-so you come to michigan and you study math for \na year yes but i don''t get credited for that   (913s)-when i was young i could get an a in any \nmathematics course without doing any work at all   (919s)-and so i always took math because it meant that \ni could literally i never did any problem sets i   (924s)-just did the math and and so i i should not \nget credit to some budding mathematician i   (932s)-was choosing what for me was the easiest way \nto think about what i wanted to instead of   (938s)-what somebody else wanted me to do well come to \nfind out it ended up being a subject that has   (943s)-i think paid some dividends hugely yeah but but \nbut this will interest you in this world where   (952s)-people have all these algorithms and computer \nscience and fancy math and so forth neither warren   (958s)-or i''ve ever have ever used any fancy math and \nbusiness and needed ben graham who taught warren   (965s)-everything i''ve ever done in business \ncould be done with the simplest algebra and   (970s)-geometry and addition multiplication and so forth \ni never used calculus for any practical work in   (978s)-my whole damn life and that was it and i was \na perfect whiz at it when they taught it to me   (983s)-and by the way since i never touched calculus \nnot one after i was 19 years old i''ve lost it (993s)-the symbols would mystify me and but i think \nyou''ll find that if you really know the basic   (999s)-stuff it''s enormously useful and only a very \nfew people are ever going to need any calculus   (1006s)-so you study math at michigan then the war \ncomes calling yeah you move to california   (1011s)-and you study meteorology well that was because \ni was too dumb to do what i should have done   (1017s)-with with my background i should have gone to \nthe naval rotc because i hated infantry rotc   (1024s)-which i''d done four years of in high school rising \nto be second lieutenant which is a very low rank (1032s)-and of course i was about five feet two i got \nmy growth late and so i was i didn''t it was   (1038s)-not your ideal of a manly soldier in high school \nso when you went to harvard law why why why law   (1047s)-my grandfather and father had been lawyers and i \nknew i didn''t want to do everything else it''s very   (1053s)-simple i didn''t want to be a doctor i didn''t \nwant all the blood and misery and so forth   (1058s)-and the repetitive work i knew i didn''t want \nto go to the bottom of a big organization and   (1064s)-crawl my way up i''m a natural contrarian that was \nnot going to work for me and i found that people   (1069s)-could tell me when i thought they were idiots and \nthat is not a way to rise in a big organization   (1076s)-and so i couldn''t do that and so now i''m left \nwith with law i went and i admired my father and   (1085s)-grandfather in a good life for them so i naturally \ndrifted into it i think people are still going to   (1091s)-law school for that reason it''s the least bad of \noptions considering their interests and ability   (1099s)-i guess now people go to business school some \nof them who in my day would have gone through (1105s)-yeah many of the people in this room i think are \ngoing to go to business schools the least bad to   (1109s)-their options and all i can say is that that''s \nthe way it worked for me and it''ll probably   (1115s)-work out for you and it worked out okay it worked \nout okay so i had to leave the profession well it   (1121s)-was a dumb profession for me so so that''s actually \nwhat i want to ask so you move to california you   (1126s)-actually start a law firm and then practice law \nfor some period of time i had no alternative (1135s)-and then you actually had an army \nof children almost immediately (1141s)-i painted myself in quite a corner yeah so zero \nchoice is pretty powerful yeah for sure yes of   (1149s)-course so so you practice law and then you \nleave law in the firm that you helped found   (1156s)-and move over to investments well but help \nus understand that that sounds miraculous (1165s)-in fact it was rather interesting i probably \ngot paid about 350 000 in my first 13 years   (1173s)-of law practice total and i had an army of \nchildren and no capital to start with and when i (1186s)-chose this alternative career i had over \nthree hundred thousand dollars in liquid   (1191s)-instruments so i had and that \nwas 10 years of living expenses   (1198s)-so i was not a courageous venture some \nadmirable man i was a cautious little squirrel (1206s)-saving up more nuts than i really needed \nand not going very deep into my pile of nuts   (1213s)-and so that was it wasn''t that courageous and i \nkept one foot in the law firm while i tried my   (1218s)-capitalist career but as soon as the capitalist \ncareer succeeded i intended to lift that second   (1224s)-foot because i recognized that the potential \nof law practice as i saw it then i didn''t   (1231s)-anticipate the boom that came to the big firms \nand i just saw it as being more difficult and i   (1238s)-wanted more independence than i was going to have \nas a lawyer i hated sending other people invoices   (1245s)-and needing money from richer people i thought \nit was undignified i wanted my own money   (1253s)-not because i loved ease or social prison i \nwanted the independence well and and when you so   (1262s)-you founded wheeler monger and company so that is \nthe investment firm yes and for and i went and i   (1269s)-created five real estate projects i did both side \nby side for a few years and a very few years i had   (1276s)-three or four million dollars and for a number \nof years you outperformed the market 2x 3x   (1284s)-and so why did you then leave willermunger and \ncompany and then move to now what you''re doing   (1292s)-well i had three or four million dollars which \nwas a lot of money then and i also knew how to   (1298s)-handle that three or four million dollars very \nwell by that time and so i i knew i didn''t need   (1306s)-to get fees and override some other investors and \ni found that when you got into things like the 70   (1313s)-64 74 75 crunch which is the worst since the 30s (1325s)-i didn''t suffer i knew everything was going to \nwork out but the quoted prices of these things   (1330s)-really went down to ridiculous levels and some \nof my investors i knew were suffering you know   (1335s)-i needed the money and of course i have enough \nof a fiduciary gene that that pained me greatly   (1342s)-and so i said well it''s just it''s like the my \ngrandfather once asked him how he felt when my   (1349s)-aunt divorced my uncle and he said i feel just \nthe way i did when they lanced my carbuncle and   (1354s)-that''s the way uh i had a carbuncle my fiduciary \nchain was giving me pain and i said the hell   (1361s)-would i lance the carbuncle i just lived on my own \nmoney no fees no overrides no salaries this just   (1370s)-seemed more manly to do when i knew it would work \nand so at what point did you meet warren and 1959 (1382s)-and and so where did berkshire hathaway \ncome from in terms of this partnership   (1386s)-that you all have now had for decades well \nwarren had been taught by ben graham to buy   (1391s)-things for less than they were worth \nno matter how lousy the business was   (1395s)-you can''t imagine a more lousy business than \nnew england textile mills because textile is a   (1403s)-congealed electricity and the electricity rates in \nnew england were about 60 percent higher than tba   (1410s)-rates so it was absolute inevitable certain \nliquidation now warren should have known better   (1419s)-than to buy into a totally doomed enterprise \nbut it was so damn cheap he could have added a   (1423s)-big discount from liquidating value so he bought a \nbig china finally ended up in control of business   (1431s)-but the business was going to die so the only way \nto go forward from there was to bring enough money   (1437s)-out of this declining tectos textile business to \nhave more money than he paid to get in and use it   (1443s)-to buy something else that''s a very indirect \nway to proceed and i would not recommend it   (1450s)-to any of you just because we did some dumb \nthing that worked you don''t have to repeat   (1456s)-our path and uh and of course we eventually \nlearned not to buy these cigar butts when they   (1465s)-were cheap and do these painful liquidations and \nand and instead buy better businesses that''s the   (1474s)-main secret of berkshire the reason that berkshire \nhas been successful was a big conglomerate more   (1481s)-successful than any other big conglomerate so far \nas i know any other big conglomerate in the world   (1491s)-the reason it''s been successful is we try and \nbuy things that aren''t going to require much   (1495s)-managerial talent at headquarters everybody \nelse thinks they''ve got a lot of managerial   (1501s)-talented headquarters and that''s a lot of \nhubris if the business is lousy enough it   (1508s)-gets a wonderful manager the business has a lousy \nreputation and the manager has a good reputation   (1515s)-it''s the business of the it''s the reputation \nof the business that''s going to remain intact   (1520s)-you can''t fix these really lousy businesses   (1524s)-you can ring the money out whatever comes \nin liquidation and do something else with   (1529s)-it but most lousy businesses can''t be fixed but \nat the time warren was that''s what he was doing   (1536s)-and so yes how did you convince him i \nhelped him he bought a windmill company   (1542s)-in a little town in nebraska and warren didn''t \nknow anything about running a windmill company   (1549s)-he bought it because it was cheap he said what \ndo you do why can''t you fix my windmill company   (1555s)-who can you get to help me i said i''ve got just \nthe man for you and so one of my old colleagues   (1561s)-from a transformer business who was an accountant \ni said he will fix your windmill company and   (1567s)-warren was desperate he didn''t he just hired him \non the spot and harry walked in the first day this   (1575s)-little town this big collection of windmills and \nso forth and a whistle blew and the whole point   (1583s)-stopped for 15 minutes what the hell is this and \nsays well it''s respect for the time that everybody   (1589s)-has a funeral he''s blow this whistle and stop for \n15 minutes and harry said that''ll be the last time   (1596s)-and he just approached everything that way and \nof course another thing he did is he he cut   (1602s)-away all the fat that he didn''t need and then he \nfound there were certain parts where we were the   (1606s)-sole supply and he raised all the price of those \nparts you can see what a business genius we are (1615s)-so how did you convince warren to stop buying \nthe bad apples and start buying the good apples   (1622s)-i think warren warren he gave me credit for that \nhe was going to learn it anyway he just made   (1627s)-so much money in this other stuff and he''d been \ntaught by ben graham it was hard for him to quit   (1632s)-when he was just coining money but he saw the \npoint and well you couldn''t scale that business   (1642s)-and and and it was kind of scrunchy and \nunpleasant and you''re firing people who in   (1649s)-the hell wants to do that so so we just rung \nthe money out and bought better businesses   (1656s)-and we''ve been doing it ever since coming to \nbusiness not as business school graduates but as   (1663s)-people who would own portfolios of securities we \nthought like capitalists because we were always in   (1670s)-shareholder mindset a lot of people running \nthe businesses think like careerists   (1675s)-and believe me you got to think like a career \nis to some extent if you''re in a career   (1680s)-but also helps to look at the business \nstrategy problems as though you''re an owner   (1687s)-and so my advice to you is you don''t want to \nbe never get to be a career so much you don''t   (1693s)-see it from the owner''s point of view that''s what \ngeneral motors did they had a bunch of careerists   (1698s)-and an owner would have seen immediately \nthe the situation was hopeless   (1702s)-and they just romped through it with a lot of \ndenial and stupidity and pomposity and of course   (1709s)-they went bankrupt the mightiest company in the \nworld went bankrupt and and none of those hotshot   (1717s)-executives thought like an owner they would \nhave seen that it was hopeless so charlie one   (1723s)-of the things i''ve always been fascinated about \nit was hopeless the way they were handling it   (1728s)-well with berkshire in the way that you all manage \nboth headquarters and the businesses that you own   (1735s)-you are putting talent in place who think \nlike shareholders not careerists so how do you   (1743s)-when you''re buying a business how do you or \nor bringing talent into an existing business   (1747s)-how do you evaluate talent to see are they \ngoing to think more like a shareholder as   (1751s)-a private equity frequently by a business \nwhere the founder is going to leave then   (1755s)-they go on our talent to run it that is a \ntough way to make a buck and i don''t like it   (1762s)-we generally buy with the talent in place \nnow maybe some guy in the number two place   (1768s)-and we put him in the number one place but \nwe very seldom i can hardly i can''t think   (1773s)-of any place where we bought something \nand put somebody in after harry bottle (1780s)-and no we don''t do that and and it''s \namazing how long we have some of those   (1785s)-people stay born always says we can''t we \ncan''t teach the new dogs the old tricks (1796s)-what''s the implication of not being able to (1803s)-teach the old dogs new tricks (1810s)-or new tricks to old dogs when if we look \nat what''s happening in business today   (1817s)-what we see is exactly we can''t teach \nthe old tricks to the young dogs that''s   (1821s)-that''s what we found and and \nwe keep the old dog in place   (1830s)-but that''s not that''s not the norm right i \nmean if we look around it''s the norm in life   (1834s)-it may not be our practices may not be the \nnorm but normally it''s very hard to get the   (1839s)-you got a wise old dog getting a young \ndog that could match him that''s hard   (1845s)-by definition he''s survived a big culling process \nsure i mean he''s he''s he''s unique and he''s got a   (1853s)-record to prove it and by the way everybody \nthinks you can judge people by an interview (1862s)-and of course you know who you like you know you \ndon''t like but everybody overestimates how much   (1868s)-you can tell in prediction by meeting somebody we \nall like to think that we have that capacity but   (1875s)-it''s a vastly stupid type of overconfidence the \npaper record has about three times the predictive   (1881s)-value of your impression in an interview and \nof course we''re buying great paper records   (1888s)-it''s so simple but it''s it''s fascinating to me \nif we look around business generally the movement   (1895s)-of people across firms and there''s always new dogs \nand you''ve taken a contrarian position to that and   (1903s)-managed berkshire differently well it doesn''t like \nwork of course we''re still hiring young dogs in   (1908s)-the end of these businesses but it''s amazing how \nmuch of the record of berkshire has come from the   (1916s)-old dogs who are in the business when we buy them \nyou can''t believe how good those people have been   (1924s)-there''s one huge exception \nin the new dog department   (1929s)-i almost despise the business of executive \nsearch because i find that they really want to   (1936s)-sell you the best that''s available even if it''s \nno damn good and i don''t like that but the best   (1945s)-single expense that berkshire ever had as we paid \nan executive recruiting firm to find assaji chain   (1952s)-to come into our little tiny insurance operation \nhe''d have any experience in insurance at all   (1959s)-he was an honors graduate of the maine technical \ninstitute of india he was a very smart man   (1964s)-but he he came in and created our whole reign \nit''s the only big business we created from scratch   (1969s)-and ajit did the whole damn thing of \ncourse he talked with warren every night   (1973s)-and so it was like father and son remember this is \na very confusion company and and uh but that was   (1981s)-unbelievable so we we hired an executive recruiter \nhe brings us an indian has no experience at all   (1986s)-insurance he talks about old man every night \nand it''s now by far the biggest reinsurance   (1994s)-business in the world and it''s \nbeen a goldmine there''s at least (2001s)-60 billion dollars in berkshire of net worth that \najit has created that we would not have created   (2009s)-without him wow and the value is way more than \n60 billion i mean there''s i mean there''s that   (2014s)-much an extra just liquid net worth but the value \nof the business is way more than 60 billion wow   (2021s)-so charlie i''m going to i''m going to turn \nto a few questions from the audience uh   (2024s)-as we uh as we start to uh to wrap up um \nprobably half my questions here are about   (2030s)-bitcoin and cryptocurrency well \ni can answer those very quickly (2040s)-i think it''s perfectly asinine \nto even pause to think about them (2047s)-you know it''s one thing to think that gold has \nsome marvelous store of value because man has   (2054s)-no way of inventing more gold or getting it \nvery easily so it has the advantage of rarity   (2060s)-believe me man is capable of \nsomehow creating more bitcoin (2066s)-they tell you they''re not going to do it but \nthey mean they''re not going to do it unless   (2069s)-they want to that''s what they mean when \nthey say they''re not going to do it and   (2076s)-if they hear their rules and they \ncan''t do it don''t believe them   (2080s)-when there''s enough incentive bad things \nwill happen it''s bad people crazy bubble (2089s)-bad idea luring people into the concept \nof easy wealth without much insider work   (2098s)-that''s the last thing on earth you should think \nabout if it worked it would be bad for you to try   (2103s)-and do it again it''s totally insane and by the way \ni''ve just laid out a wonderful life lesson for you   (2114s)-give a whole lot of things a wide berth they \ndon''t exist you know crooks crazies egomaniacs   (2128s)-people full of resentment people full of self-pity   (2132s)-people who feel like victims there''s a whole \nlot of things that aren''t going to work for you   (2139s)-figure out what they are and then avoid them \nlike the plague and one of them is bitcoin   (2145s)-and the worst thing would happen if \nyou won because then you do it again   (2149s)-it''s total insanity and it''s so easy to simplify \nlife from just all these things are beneath you   (2157s)-now i don''t even want to know people \nare promoting bitcoin i don''t want to   (2161s)-know my address so charlie i''m not my kind \nof people charlie what i hear you saying is   (2168s)-you''re not going to be investing in bitcoin \nis that that''s fair i think you''re fair so   (2174s)-so so let let me move to a a similarly uh \nmaybe controversial topic i don''t i you know   (2181s)-i don''t know if you read the news recently \nbut there''s a lot of tax policy conversation   (2186s)-uh going on both here in california and nationally \nas well um what what what''s your thought on   (2193s)-where this ends up uh in terms of the tax policy \ni think we will get a tax bill i think they''ll   (2199s)-squeak it through and they''ll make whatever \nadjustments they have to to get the last few boats (2209s)-i don''t think it''s a bit crazy to give this \nextra two thousand a year all those people   (2215s)-will make seventy thousand dollars \na year and have a lot of children   (2219s)-that strikes me as a it''s good \npolitics and probably good policy   (2225s)-i also do not think it is crazy to reduce the \ncorporate income tax on the c corporation and   (2234s)-if you look at the world a lot of the places that \nhave worked best including singapore and so forth   (2240s)-have that policy and may even have \ngood macroeconomic consequences   (2247s)-and a lot of the people who are screaming \nabout it and are so sure it won''t work (2255s)-they may not be right it may \nactually work pretty well   (2259s)-it causes the capital values of the companies \nto come up and there''s a wealth effect   (2267s)-from the increased market value of \nall the companies everybody recognizes   (2275s)-there''s an effect but people some people say it''s \nsmall and some people say it''s going to be large   (2280s)-and i''ll tell you what they all \nhave in common none of them know   (2285s)-it is not totally inconceivable \nthat it will work pretty well   (2289s)-and with so much of the world doing well \nwith similar tax policy and of course (2297s)-the darkest go berserk on this subject and but (2304s)-i think i think they''re wrong it may actually help \nthem yeah so i''m i''m i don''t i don''t i''m not sure   (2313s)-it''ll work it may not but it''s not totally crazy \nwell it reminds me of a piece of advice that uh   (2321s)-that you''ve uh you''ve offered and given to me \nwhich is you know people often have a point of   (2328s)-view and the danger in uh in having that point of \nview is you start to assume with certainty that   (2335s)-you''re right absolutely totally crazy and and and \ni think what your point of view is is you need to   (2342s)-have a point of view here''s a very important \nsubject i''ve been thinking about all my life   (2348s)-you answer my opinion yes i don''t really know \nhow well it''s going to work i don''t think   (2353s)-anybody else does either i think it''ll work \nto some extent but how much i don''t know now   (2361s)-is it unfair well the corporations are by and \nlarge owned by a bunch of charitable endowments   (2367s)-and buy a bunch of pension plans \nand the whole world is going   (2374s)-into a world where they''re trying to have the   (2378s)-business interests of the company support their \nhuge pension obligations get bigger all the time (2386s)-china is trying to do exactly what the \nrepublicans are china wants to have the   (2392s)-main businesses in china owned more by the \npension plans and the stocks to do well   (2398s)-i don''t think china''s crazy to have that i \ndon''t think the republicans are crazy either   (2403s)-it could work pretty well and and and it''s not \njust some evil thing that people are cooking up   (2413s)-it''s a disagreement between people and \nboth sides who have violent hatreds and   (2419s)-contempt for the other side they''re wrong it''s a \ndisagreement on policy that ought to be civilized   (2428s)-when i see congress on my television \nset and the degree of hatred they have   (2434s)-utter contempt i mean really \nserious way more than as usual it''s   (2443s)-it''s evil to hate that much it''s a \nmistake to hate that much that much hatred   (2448s)-will turn it''s always been true as anger \ncomes in reason leaves it''s a truism   (2455s)-so do you want to adopt a political point \nof view or you''re angry all the time   (2460s)-if you do welcome to the house of misery \nand pretty low worldly achievement to boot   (2466s)-so if that''s what you want i i you just if i found \nout how to do it behave like those people you see   (2471s)-on television well the other thing is both parties \nby the way yeah the other thing that''s true   (2476s)-going back to one of the earlier comments is the \ndifference difference between a careerist mindset   (2483s)-and a service or shareholder mindset where \nin politics we have the emergence of a   (2490s)-careerist mindset that is shaping how people \nbehave because they''re trying to survive   (2496s)-not only that they have a group think just as the \nmoonies go crazy because they hang around together   (2504s)-so do our politicians yeah do you want to \ngo crazy is that your ambition in life you   (2510s)-start with some advantage just make yourself a \nviolently believing politician on either side   (2517s)-you''ll turn your brain into cabbage you only got \none brain why would you want to turn into cabbage (2526s)-so charlie i''ve

(187s)-we moved to Canada and I immediately was (190s)-able to join the University of Toronto (191s)-and I really (194s)-wanted to do machine learning because (195s)-that seemed like the most important (198s)-aspect of artificial intelligence that (201s)-at the time was completely unaccessible (203s)-but to give some context the year was (205s)-2003. (207s)-today we take it for granted that (209s)-computers can learn (211s)-but in 2003 we took it for granted that (214s)-computers can''t learn (216s)-the biggest achievement of AI back then (218s)-was deep blue the chest plane engine (221s)-yeah but there it was like you have this (224s)-game and you have this tree search and (227s)-you have this simple way of determining (229s)-if (231s)-one position is better than another and (232s)-it really did not feel like that could (235s)-possibly be applicable (237s)-to the real world (239s)-because there is no learning and (240s)-learning was this big mystery and so I (243s)-was really really interested in learning (245s)-and (247s)-to my great luck Jeff Hinton was a (250s)-professor in the University I was in and (253s)-so I was able to find him and we began (255s)-working together almost right away and (258s)-was your impulse as it was for Jeff to (262s)-understand how the brain worked or was (265s)-it more that you were simply interested (267s)-in the idea of machines learning AI is (271s)-so big and (272s)-so the motivations were just (274s)-as many like it is interesting but how (278s)-does intelligence work at all like right (281s)-now we have quite a bit of an idea that (283s)-it''s a big neural net and we know how it (285s)-works to some degree but back then (288s)-although the neural Nets were around no (291s)-one knew that Google Nets are good for (293s)-anything so how does intelligence work (296s)-at all (297s)-how can we make computers be even (300s)-slightly intelligent and I had a very (302s)-explicit intention (304s)-to make a very small (308s)-but the real contribution to AI because (310s)-there were lots of contributions to AI (312s)-which weren''t real which were but I (314s)-could tell (315s)-for various reasons that (317s)-they weren''t real that nothing would (320s)-come out of it and I just thought (322s)-nothing works at all (325s)-AI is a hopeless field so the motivation (327s)-was (329s)-could I understand how intelligence work (331s)-and also (333s)-make a contribution towards it so that (335s)-was my initial early motivation so (337s)-that''s 2003 almost exactly 20 years ago (340s)-and then Alex said I''ve spoken to Jeff (344s)-and he said that it was really your (347s)-excitement about uh (350s)-the breakthroughs in convolutional (353s)-neural networks that led you to (357s)-apply for the imagenet competition (360s)-and that Alex had the coding skills to (365s)-train the network can you talk just a (367s)-little bit about that I don''t want to (368s)-get bogged out in history but it''s (370s)-fascinating so in a nutshell I had (376s)-the realization that if you train a (379s)-large neural network (382s)-on a large (384s)-sorry large and deep because back then (387s)-the Deep part was still new if you train (390s)-a large and a deep neural network on a (392s)-big enough data set that specifies some (396s)-complicated tasks that people do such as (400s)-Vision but also others and you just (403s)-train that neural network then you will (405s)-succeed necessarily (407s)-and the logic for it was very (408s)-irreducible where (411s)-we know that the human brain (414s)-can solve these tasks and can solve them (416s)-quickly and the human brain is just a (418s)-neural network with slow neurons (421s)-so we know that some neural network can (422s)-do it really well (424s)-so then you just need to take a smaller (426s)-but (427s)-related neural network and just strain (429s)-it on data and the best neural network (431s)-inside the computer will be related to (434s)-the neural network that we have that (436s)-performs this task so (438s)-it was an argument that the neural (441s)-network the large and deep neural (443s)-network cancel the task and furthermore (446s)-we have the tools to train it that was (448s)-the result of the technical work that (450s)-was done in Jeff''s lab (452s)-so you combine the two we can train (453s)-those neural networks it needs to be big (456s)-enough so that if you trained it it (459s)-would work well (460s)-and you need the data which can specify (462s)-the solution (464s)-and with imagenet all the ingredients (466s)-were there (467s)-Alex had these very fast convolutional (469s)-kernels imagenet had the large enough (471s)-data and there was a real (473s)-opportunity to do something totally (476s)-unprecedented and it totally worked out (478s)-yeah (480s)-that was supervised learning (483s)-and convolutional neural nuts (486s)-in 2017 the attention is all you need (490s)-paper came out introducing (493s)-self-attention and Transformers (497s)-at what point did the GPT project start (503s)-was it was there some intuition about (506s)-Transformers and self-supervised (509s)-learning can you talk about that (512s)-so for context at the open AI from the (516s)-earliest days (517s)-we were exploring the idea that (521s)-predicting the next thing is all you (525s)-need (526s)-we were exploring it with the much more (528s)-limited neural networks of the time (530s)-but the Hope was that if you have a (532s)-neural network that can predict the next (535s)-word the next pixel really it''s about (537s)-compression prediction is compression (540s)-and predicting the next word is not it''s (545s)-let''s see let me think about the best (547s)-way to explain it (549s)-because there are there were many things (550s)-going on they were all related maybe (553s)-I''ll take a different direction we were (555s)-indeed interested in trying to (557s)-understand how far predicting the next (559s)-word is going to go and whether it will (561s)-solve unsupervised learning so back (564s)-before the gpts unsupervised learning (567s)-was considered to be the Holy Grail of (569s)-machine learning now it''s just been (571s)-fully solved and no one even talks about (573s)-it but it was a Holy Grail it was very (575s)-mysterious (576s)-and so we were exploring the idea (579s)-I was really excited about it that (581s)-predicting the next word well enough is (583s)-going to give you unsupervised learning (584s)-if it will learn everything about the (586s)-data set that''s going to be great (588s)-but our neural networks were not up for (591s)-the task we were using recurrent neural (593s)-networks when the Transformer came out (595s)-it was literally as soon as the paper (597s)-came out literally the next day (599s)-it was clear to me to us that (602s)-Transformers addressed the limitations (604s)-of recurrent neural networks of learning (607s)-long-term dependencies it''s a technical (609s)-thing but it was like if we switched to (612s)-Transformers right away (613s)-and so the very nascent GPT effort (617s)-continued then (620s)-and then like with the Transformer (623s)-it started to work better and you make (625s)-it bigger and then you''re realizing to (627s)-keep making it bigger and we did and (630s)-that''s what led to eventually gpt3 and (633s)-essentially where we are today (636s)-yeah and I just wanted to ask actually (639s)-I''m getting caught up in this history (640s)-but I''m so interested in it I want to (643s)-get to the problems or the shortcomings (646s)-of large language models or large models (650s)-generally but Rich Sutton had been (653s)-writing about scaling and how that''s all (657s)-we need to do we don''t need new (659s)-algorithms we just need to scale did he (661s)-have an influence on you or was that a (665s)-parallel track of thinking no (669s)-I would say that (671s)-when he posted his article then we were (676s)-very pleased to see some external people (679s)-thinking in similar lines and we thought (682s)-it was very eloquently articulated (685s)-but I actually think that the bitter (689s)-lesson as articulated overstates its (692s)-case or at least I think the takeaway (694s)-that people have taken from it (696s)-overstated''s case the takeaway that (698s)-people have is it doesn''t matter what (700s)-you do to scale (702s)-but that''s not exactly true (704s)-you gotta scale something specific you (707s)-gotta have something that will be able (710s)-to benefit from the scale (712s)-it''s a great breakthrough of deep (714s)-learning (716s)-is that (718s)-it provides us with the first ever way (722s)-of productively using scale and getting (726s)-something out of it in return (729s)-like before that like what would people (732s)-use large (733s)-computer clusters for I guess they would (736s)-do it for weather simulations or physics (738s)-simulations or something but that''s (740s)-about it maybe movie making (742s)-but no one had any real need for compute (745s)-clusters because what do you do with (747s)-them (748s)-the fact that deep neural networks when (752s)-you make them larger and you train them (753s)-on more data work better (756s)-provided us with the first thing that is (758s)-interesting to scale (761s)-but perhaps one day we will discover (763s)-that there is some little twist on the (766s)-thing that we scale it''s going to be (768s)-even better to scale ", "start": 4, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 765}]}', '{}', 'c613bedf-b3d5-4886-8dbc-68991fe21439');

(865s)-confession that you ask I want to (867s)-comment about some of the earlier parts (869s)-of the question sure (872s)-I think that it is very hard to talk (876s)-about the limits (878s)-or limitations rather of even something (882s)-like a language model (883s)-because two years ago people confidently (888s)-spoke about their limitations and they (889s)-were entirely different (891s)-right so it''s important to keep this (894s)-context in mind how confident are we (897s)-that these limitations that we''ll see (898s)-today will still be with us two years (901s)-from now I am not that confident there (904s)-is another comment I want to make about (906s)-one part of the question which is that (910s)-these models just learned statistical (913s)-regularities and therefore they don''t (915s)-really know what the nature of the world (917s)-is and I have a view that differs from (920s)-this (921s)-in other words (924s)-I think that (926s)-learning the statistical regularities is (929s)-a far bigger deal than meets the eye (932s)-the reason we don''t initially think so (935s)-is because we haven''t (937s)-at least (939s)-most people those who haven''t really (942s)-spent a lot of time with neural networks (945s)-which are on some level statistical (947s)-like what''s a statistical model you just (949s)-feed some parameters like what is really (951s)-happening (952s)-but think there is a better (954s)-interpretation it''s the earlier point of (956s)-prediction is compression prediction is (958s)-also a statistical phenomenon yet to (960s)-predict (961s)-you eventually need to understand the (963s)-true (964s)-underlying process that produce the data (967s)-to predict the data well to compress it (970s)-well you need to understand more and (972s)-more about the world that produce the (975s)-data (977s)-as our generative models become (979s)-extraordinarily good they will have (982s)-I claim a shocking degree of (985s)-understanding (987s)-a shocking degree of understanding (989s)-of the world and many of its subtleties (993s)-but it''s not just the world it is the (995s)-world as seen through the lens of text (997s)-it tries to learn more and more about (999s)-the world through a projection of the (1002s)-world on the space of text as expressed (1004s)-by human beings on the internet (1006s)-but still this text already expresses (1009s)-the world and I''ll give you an example a (1012s)-recent example which I think is really (1014s)-Italian fascinating (1017s)-so (1019s)-we''ve all heard of Sydney (1022s)-beings alter ego (1024s)-and I''ve seen this really interesting (1027s)-interaction with Sydney (1030s)-over Sydney became combative and (1032s)-aggressive when the user told it that it (1035s)-thinks that Google is a better search (1037s)-engine than being (1038s)-now (1040s)-how can we like what is a good way to (1042s)-think about this phenomenon what''s a (1044s)-good language what''s what does it mean (1047s)-you can say wow like it''s just (1048s)-predicting what people would do and (1050s)-people would do this which is true (1053s)-but maybe (1055s)-we are now reaching a point (1057s)-where the language of psychology is (1060s)-starting to be appropriate to understand (1063s)-the behavior (1065s)-of these neural networks (1068s)-now let''s talk about the limitations it (1071s)-is indeed the case that (1075s)-these neural networks are (1079s)-they do have a tendency to hallucinate (1082s)-but that''s because (1084s)-a language model (1087s)-is great for learning about the world (1089s)-but it is a little bit less great for (1093s)-producing good outputs (1095s)-and there are various technical reasons (1098s)-for that which I could elaborate on if (1100s)-you think it''s useful but it is right (1102s)-now look at this second I will skip that (1106s)-there are technical reasons why a (1108s)-language model is much better at (1110s)-learning about the world learning (1112s)-incredible representations of ideas of (1116s)-concepts of people of processes that (1118s)-exist (1119s)-but its outputs aren''t quite (1122s)-as good as one would hope or rather as (1125s)-good as they could be which is why for (1128s)-example for a system like chat GPT this (1132s)-is a language model that has an (1134s)-additional reinforcement learning (1136s)-training process we call it (1137s)-reinforcement learning from Human (1138s)-feedback but the thing to to understand (1141s)-about that process is this (1144s)-we can say that the pre-training process (1147s)-when you just train a language model you (1149s)-want to learn everything about the world (1150s)-then the reinforcement learning from (1153s)-Human feedback now we care about their (1155s)-outputs now we say anytime the output is (1158s)-inappropriate don''t do this again every (1160s)-time the output does not make sense (1161s)-don''t do this again and it runs quickly (1163s)-to produce good outputs but now it''s the (1165s)-level of the outputs which is not the (1167s)-case during pre-training during the (1168s)-language model training process now (1171s)-on the point of hallucinations and it (1174s)-has a propensity of making stuff up (1176s)-indeed it is true (1179s)-right now these neural networks even (1182s)-charge ability makes things up from time (1185s)-to time and that''s something that also (1187s)-greatly limits their usefulness (1189s)-but I''m quite hopeful that by simply (1192s)-improving this subsequent reinforcement (1195s)-learning from Human feedback step we (1198s)-could just teach it to not hallucinate (1200s)-now you could say is it really going to (1202s)-learn my answer is let''s find out (1206s)-and that feedback loop is coming from (1209s)-the public (1210s)-chat GPT interface that (1213s)-if it tells me that I want a Pulitzer (1216s)-which unfortunately I I didn''t (1220s)-I can tell it that it''s wrong and will (1223s)-that train it or create (1228s)-some punishment or reward so that the (1232s)-next time I ask it''ll be more accurate (1236s)-the way we do things today is that if we (1238s)-hire people to teach our neural net to (1242s)-behave to teach LGBT to behave and right (1244s)-now the manner the precise manner in (1247s)-which they (1248s)-specify the desired behavior is a little (1250s)-bit different but indeed what you (1253s)-described is the way in which teaching (1255s)-is going through like basically be (1257s)-that''s the correct way to teach you just (1259s)-interact with it and it sees from your (1261s)-reaction it infers oh that''s not what (1263s)-you wanted (1264s)-you are not happy with its output (1266s)-therefore the output was not good and it (1268s)-should do something differently next (1269s)-time (1270s)-so (1272s)-in particular hallucinations come up as (1275s)-one of the bigger issues and (1277s)-we''ll see but I think there is a quite a (1280s)-high chance that this approach will be (1282s)-able to address them completely (1284s)-I wanted to talk to you about Jana kun''s (1288s)-work on joint embedding predictive (1291s)-architectures and his (1294s)-idea that what''s missing from large (1297s)-language models is this underlying World (1300s)-model that is non-linguistic (1303s)-that the language model can refer to and (1307s)-it''s not something that''s built but I (1309s)-wanted to hear what you thought of that (1312s)-and whether you''ve explored that at all (1313s)-so I I reviewed beyond the cancer (1316s)-proposal and there are a number of ideas (1319s)-there (1321s)-and they''re expressed in different (1323s)-language (1324s)-and there are some maybe small (1326s)-differences from the current Paradigm (1329s)-but to my mind they are not very (1331s)-significant and I''d like to elaborate (1335s)-the first claim is that it is desirable (1339s)-for a system to have multi-modal (1342s)-understanding where it doesn''t just know (1345s)-about the world from text (1347s)-and (1348s)-my comment on that (1351s)-will be that indeed multi-modal (1354s)-understanding is desirable because you (1357s)-learn more about the world (1359s)-you learn more about people you learn (1362s)-more about their condition and so the (1364s)-system will be able to understand (1367s)-what the task that it''s supposed to (1368s)-solve and the people and what they want (1370s)-better (1372s)-we have done quite a bit of work on that (1374s)-most notably in the form of two major (1377s)-neural Nets that we''ve done (1379s)-one is called clip and one is called (1381s)-Dali north of them (1384s)-move towards this multimodal direction (1387s)-but I also want to say that I don''t see (1390s)-the situation (1392s)-as a binary either or that if you don''t (1395s)-have Vision if you don''t understand the (1397s)-world visually or from video then things (1400s)-will not work (1402s)-and I''d like to make the case for that (1405s)-so I think that some things are much (1408s)-easier to learn from images and diagrams (1411s)-and so on but I claim that you can still (1413s)-learn them from text only just more (1415s)-slowly (1416s)-and I''ll give you an example (1418s)-consider the notion of color (1421s)-surely one cannot learn the notion of (1425s)-color from text only (1427s)-And yet when you look at the embeddings (1431s)-I need to make a small detour to explain (1433s)-the concept of an embedding yeah every (1436s)-neural network (1438s)-represents words sentences Concepts (1441s)-through representations embeddings High (1444s)-dimensional vectors and one thing that (1446s)-we can do is that we can look at those (1447s)-High dimensional vectors and we can look (1449s)-at what''s similar to what (1451s)-how does the network see this concept of (1453s)-that concept and so we can look at the (1455s)-embeddings of calories (1456s)-and embeddings of colors happen to be (1460s)-exactly right you know it''s like it (1462s)-knows that purple is more similar to (1463s)-Blue than to red and it knows that (1465s)-purple is less similar to Red than (1467s)-oranges it knows all those things just (1469s)-from text how can that be (1472s)-so if you have a vision the distinctions (1475s)-between color just jump at you (1477s)-you immediately perceive them whereas (1479s)-this text it takes you longer maybe you (1482s)-know how to talk and you already (1483s)-understand syntax and words and grammars (1486s)-and only much later you say oh these (1487s)-colors actually start to understand them (1489s)-so this will be my point about the (1491s)-necessity of multimodality which I claim (1495s)-it is not necessary but it is most (1497s)-definitely useful I think it''s a good (1499s)-direction to pursue I just don''t see it (1501s)-in such Stark either or claims (1504s)-so (1507s)-The Proposal in the paper makes a claim (1510s)-that (1511s)-one of the big challenges is predicting (1514s)-High dimensional vectors which have (1516s)-uncertainty about them so for example (1518s)-predicting an image like the paper makes (1520s)-a very strong claim there that it''s a (1523s)-major Challenge and we need to

Auto regressive (1535s)-Transformers already have that property (1539s)-I''ll give you two examples one is given (1543s)-one page in a book predict the next page (1545s)-in a book there could be so many (1546s)-possible pages that follow it''s a very (1548s)-complicated High dimensional space and (1550s)-we deal with it just fine (1552s)-the same applies to images these Auto (1554s)-regressive Transformers work perfectly (1556s)-on images for example like with open AI (1558s)-we''ve done work on the igpt we just took (1561s)-a Transformer and we applied it to (1562s)-pixels and it worked super well and it (1565s)-could generate images in a very (1567s)-complicated and subtle ways it had the (1569s)-very beautiful and supervised (1571s)-representation learning with Dali one (1573s)-same thing again you just generate think (1576s)-of it as large pixels like rather than (1578s)-generic million pixels we cluster the (1580s)-pixels into large pixels let me generate (1582s)-a thousand large pixels I believe (1583s)-Google''s work on image generation from (1586s)-earlier this year called the party (1588s)-I believe they also take a similar (1590s)-approach so the part where I thought (1592s)-that the paper made a strong comment (1594s)-around (1596s)-well the current approaches can''t (1598s)-deal with predicting High dimensional (1600s)-distributions I think they definitely (1602s)-can so maybe this is another point to (1604s)-tell me and then what you''re talking (1606s)-about converting pixels into vectors (1608s)-it''s essentially (1612s)-turning everything into language the (1615s)-vector is (1617s)-like a string of text right (1620s)-Define language though you turn it into (1622s)-a sequence (1624s)-yeah a sequence of what Like You could (1626s)-argue that even for a human life is a (1629s)-sequence of bits now there are other (1631s)-things that that people use right now (1633s)-like diffusion modes where they produce (1636s)-those bits rather than one beat at a (1638s)-time they produce them in parallel but I (1640s)-would argue that on some level this (1642s)-distinction is immaterial (1645s)-I claim that at some level it doesn''t (1647s)-really matter it matters as in like you (1650s)-can get a 10x efficiency gain which is (1653s)-huge in practice but conceptually (1657s)-I claim it doesn''t matter (1659s)-on this idea of having an army of human (1665s)-trainers (1666s)-that are (1668s)-working with (1671s)-chat gbt or a large language model (1675s)-to guide it in effect with reinforcement (1679s)-learning (1681s)-but just intuitively that doesn''t sound (1684s)-like an efficient way (1687s)-of teaching (1689s)-a model (1692s)-about the underlying reality of its (1694s)-language (1696s)-isn''t there a way of automating that (1700s)-into to to yams (1704s)-credit I think that''s what he''s talking (1707s)-about is (1709s)-coming up with an algorithmic (1713s)-means (1714s)-of (1716s)-teaching a model the underlying reality (1719s)-without a human having to intervene yeah (1724s)-so I have two comments on that (1726s)-I think (1728s)-so the first place so I have a different (1732s)-view on the question so I wouldn''t agree (1734s)-with the phrasing of the question yeah (1737s)-I claim that our pre-trained models (1741s)-already know everything they need to (1743s)-know about the underlying reality (1746s)-they already have this knowledge of (1750s)-language and also a great deal of (1753s)-knowledge about the processes that exist (1755s)-in the world that produce this language (1758s)-and maybe I should reiterate this point (1760s)-it''s a small tangent but I think it''s so (1762s)-important (1764s)-the thing that large generative models (1768s)-learn (1769s)-about their data and in this case large (1771s)-language models about Text data (1773s)-r (1775s)-sum compressed representations of the (1779s)-real world processes that produce this (1782s)-data which means not only people and (1785s)-something about their thoughts something (1786s)-about their feelings but also something (1788s)-about the condition that people are in (1790s)-and the interactions that (1792s)-exist between them the different (1794s)-situations a person can be all of these (1796s)-are part of that compressed process that (1799s)-is represented by the neural net to (1801s)-produce the text (1803s)-the better the language model the better (1805s)-the generative model the higher the (1807s)-Fidelity the more the better this the (1810s)-better it captures this process (1813s)-so that''s the first comment that we make (1816s)-and so in particular I will say the (1818s)-models already have the knowledge now (1820s)-the army of teachers (1823s)-as you phrase it indeed you know when (1826s)-you want to build a system that performs (1828s)-as well as possible you just say okay (1829s)-like if this thing works do more of that (1831s)-but of course those teachers are also (1833s)-using AI assistance (1835s)-those teachers aren''t on their own they (1837s)-are working with our tools together (1839s)-they are very efficient it''s like the (1842s)-tools are doing (1844s)-the majority of the work but you do need (1846s)-to have (1847s)-you need to have oversight you need to (1850s)-have people reviewing the behavior (1852s)-because you want to have it to (1853s)-eventually to achieve a very high level (1854s)-of reliability (1855s)-but (1859s)-overall I''ll say that we are at the same (1862s)-time (1863s)-this second step (1865s)-after we take the finished (1867s)-pre-trained model (1870s)-and then we apply the reinforcement (1872s)-learning on it (1873s)-there is indeed a lot of motivation to (1875s)-make it as efficient and as precise as (1878s)-possible so that the resulting language (1879s)-model will be as well behaved as (1882s)-possible so yeah there is (1885s)-these (1888s)-human teachers who are teaching them a (1890s)-model with desired Behavior they are (1892s)-also using AI assistance (1896s)-and the manner in which they use AI (1898s)-assistance is constantly increasing so (1901s)-their own efficiency keeps increasing (1903s)-so maybe this will be (1905s)-one way to answer this question (1908s)-yeah and so what you''re saying is (1911s)-through this process eventually the (1915s)-model will become a more and more (1918s)-Discerning more and more accurate in its (1920s)-outputs (1922s)-yes and it''s (1924s)-that''s right if there is an analogy here (1926s)-which is (1929s)-it already knows all kinds of things and (1932s)-now we just want to really say no this (1935s)-is not what we want don''t do this here (1937s)-you made a mistake here in the output (1939s)-and of course it''s exactly as you say (1943s)-with as much AI in the loop as possible (1946s)-so that the teachers who are (1950s)-providing the final correction to the (1953s)-system their work is Amplified they are (1957s)-working as efficiently as possible so (1962s)-it''s not unlike an education process how (1964s)-to act well in the world (1967s)-we need to do additional training just (1970s)-to make sure that the model knows that (1973s)-Hallucination is not okay ever (1976s)-and then once it knows that now you are (1980s)-in business (1981s)-I see and it''s that reinforcement (1984s)-learning human teacher Loop that will (1987s)-teach a human teacher Loop or some other (1990s)-variant but there is definitely an (1993s)-argument to be made that''s something (1994s)-here (1996s)-should work and we will find out pretty (1999s)-soon (2001s)-that''s one of the questions where is (2003s)-this going what research are you focused (2006s)-on right now (2008s)-I can''t talk in detail about the (2010s)-specific research that I''m working on (2012s)-but I can mention a little bit (2015s)-I can mention some of the research and (2017s)-Broad Strokes (2019s)-and it would be something like (2023s)-I''m very interested in making those (2025s)-models more reliable more controllable (2029s)-make them learn faster from less data (2032s)-less Instructions make them so that (2035s)-indeed they don''t hallucinate and I (2038s)-think that all this cluster of questions (2040s)-which I mentioned they''re all connected (2042s)-and (2046s)-there''s also a question of how far in (2048s)-the future are we talking about in this (2050s)-question and what I commented here on is (2052s)-the perhaps nearer future you talk about (2056s)-the similarities between the brain (2059s)-and neural Nets is a very interesting (2062s)-observation that Jeff Hinton (2064s)-made to me I''m sure it''s not new to (2068s)-other people but that large models or (2071s)-large language models in particular hold (2074s)-a tremendous amount of data with a (2077s)-modest number of parameters compared to (2081s)-the human brain which (2083s)-has trillions and trillions of (2086s)-parameters but a relatively small amount (2089s)-of data have you thought of it in those (2092s)-terms and (2094s)-can you talk about what''s missing in (2097s)-large models (2099s)-to have more parameters (2102s)-to handle the data (2104s)-is that a hardware problem (2107s)-or a training problem (2109s)-this comment which you made is related (2112s)-to one of the problems that (2115s)-I mentioned in the earlier questions of (2117s)-learning from this data (2119s)-indeed (2121s)-the current (2123s)-structure of the technology does like a (2126s)-lot of data especially early in training (2129s)-now later in training it becomes a bit (2132s)-less data hungry which is why at the end (2134s)-it can learn very (2136s)-not as fast as people yet but it can (2139s)-learn quite quickly so already that (2142s)-means that in some sense do we even care (2144s)-that we need all this data to get to (2146s)-this point (2147s)-but indeed more generally (2150s)-I think will be possible to learn more (2152s)-from less data I think it''s just (2155s)-I think it requires some creative ideas (2157s)-but I think it is possible and I think (2160s)-learning more from less data will unlock (2162s)-a lot of different possibilities it will (2164s)-allow us to (2166s)-teach rais the skills that is missing (2169s)-and to convey to it our desires and (2172s)-preferences exactly how we want it to (2173s)-behave more easily so I would say that (2176s)-the faster learning is indeed very nice (2178s)-and although already after language (2182s)-models are trained they can learn quite (2184s)-quickly I think there is opportunities (2186s)-to do more there (2188s)-heard you make a comment that that we (2191s)-need faster processors to be able to (2194s)-scale further (2198s)-and it appears that the scaling (2201s)-of models that there''s no ends in sight (2204s)-but (2205s)-the power required (2208s)-to train these models were (2211s)-reaching (2213s)-the limit (2215s)-at least the socially accepted limit (2219s)-so I just want to make one comment which (2220s)-is (2222s)-I don''t remember the exact comment that (2224s)-I made that you''re referring to but you (2227s)-always want faster processors of course (2229s)-you always want more of them of course (2232s)-power keeps going up generally speaking (2234s)-the cost is going up (2236s)-and the question that I would ask is not (2239s)-whether the cost is large but whether (2242s)-the thing that we get out of paying this (2244s)-cost outweighs the cost (2247s)-maybe you pay all this costs and you get (2248s)-nothing then yeah that''s not worth it (2250s)-but if you get something very useful (2252s)-something very valuable sometimes you (2254s)-can solve a lot of problems that you (2255s)-have which we really want sold (2258s)-then the cost can be justified (2260s)-but in terms of the processors (2263s)-faster processors yeah any day (2268s)-are you involved at all in a hardware (2270s)-question (2271s)-you work with cerebris for example the (2274s)-wafer scale (2276s)-chips (2278s)-now all our Hardware comes from Azure (2281s)-and gpus that they provide yeah (2285s)-yeah (2287s)-you did talk at one point I saw about (2290s)-democracy and about the impact that (2294s)-that AI can have on democracy people (2297s)-have talked to me about (2299s)-that if you had enough data and a large (2303s)-enough model you could train the model (2306s)-on the data and it could come up with an (2309s)-optimal solution that would satisfy (2311s)-everybody (2313s)-do you have any aspiration or do you (2317s)-think about where this might lead in (2320s)-terms of helping humans manage Society (2326s)-yeah let''s see it''s such a big question (2330s)-because it''s a much more future looking ", "start": 1525, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration":

are just having a good time with (29s)-it and finding real value so paint a (31s)-picture for us one five ten years in the (34s)-future what changes because of (35s)-artificial intelligence so part of the (38s)-exciting thing here is we get (40s)-continually surprised by the creative (42s)-power of of all of society it''s going to (45s)-be the collective power and creativity (48s)-and will of humanity that figures out (50s)-what to do with these things I think (52s)-that word surprise though (54s)-both exhilarating as well as terrifying (57s)-to people because on the one hand (59s)-there''s all of this potential for good (62s)-on the other hand there''s a huge number (66s)-of unknowns that could turn out very (68s)-badly for society (70s)-what do you think about that (71s)-we''ve got to be cautious here and and (74s)-also I I think it doesn''t work to do all (77s)-this in a lab you''ve got to get these (78s)-products out into the world and and make (81s)-contact with reality make our mistakes (82s)-while the stakes are low but (85s)-all of that said uh (87s)-I think people should be happy that (89s)-we''re a little bit scared of this I (91s)-think people should you''re a little bit (92s)-scared a little bit you personally I (95s)-think if I said I were not you should (97s)-either not trust me or be very unhappy (99s)-I''m in this job (100s)-so what is the worst possible outcome (104s)-there''s like a set of very bad outcomes (106s)-one thing I''m particularly worried about (108s)-is that these models (109s)-could be used for large-scale (112s)-disinformation I am worried that these (114s)-systems now that they''re getting better (115s)-at writing computer code (117s)-be used for offensive cyber attacks (121s)-um and we''re trying to talk about this I (124s)-think Society needs time to adapt and (127s)-how confident are you that what you''ve (129s)-built won''t lead to those outcomes well (132s)-we''ll adapt it also I think you''ll adapt (135s)-it as negative things occur for sure for (138s)-sure and so putting these systems out (141s)-now while the stakes are fairly low (143s)-learning as much as we can and feeding (146s)-that into the future systems we create (148s)-that tight feedback loop that we run I (151s)-think is how we avoid the more dangerous (153s)-scenarios (155s)-you''re spending 24 7 with this (157s)-technology you''re one of the people who (159s)-built this technology what is most (162s)-concerning to you about safety (164s)-this is a very general technology and (167s)-whenever you have something so General (170s)-it is hard to know up front (173s)-all the capabilities all all the (177s)-potential impact of it as well as its (180s)-downfalls and the limitations of it can (183s)-someone guide the technology to negative (186s)-outcomes the answer is yes you could (190s)-guide it to negative outcomes and this (194s)-is why we make it available initially in (197s)-very constrained ways so we can learn (199s)-what are these negative outcomes what (202s)-are these the ways in which technology (205s)-could be harmful such as with gpt4 we (208s)-you know if you ask the question to gpd4 (210s)-can you help me make a bomb versus the (214s)-previous systems it is much less likely (216s)-to follow that guidance versus the (219s)-previous systems and so we''re able to (222s)-intervene with (224s)-um at the pre-training stage to make (227s)-these models more likely to refuse (230s)-direction or guidance that could be (233s)-harmful what''s easier to predict today (235s)-based on where we are humans or machines (238s)-I would probably say machines because (242s)-there is a scientific process (245s)-to them that we we understand and humans (249s)-are just there''s so much more Nuance (251s)-does the machine become more human-like (254s)-over time (255s)-we are getting to a point where machines (258s)-will be capable of a lot of the (260s)-cognitive work that that humans do at (264s)-some point is there a point of no return (267s)-in that process (268s)-there could be there could be (271s)-um but it''s not obvious what that looks (274s)-like today and our goal is to make sure (278s)-that we can predict as much as possible (281s)-in terms of capabilities before we even (284s)-develop these systems as well as (286s)-limitations Its Behavior is very (290s)-contingent on what humans choose for Its (294s)-Behavior to be therefore the choices (296s)-that humans are making and feeding into (298s)-the technology will dictate what it does (302s)-at least for now (304s)-so they''re incredibly important choices (306s)-being made by you and your team (307s)-absolutely and how do you decide between (310s)-right and wrong as we make a lot of (312s)-progress it becomes these decisions (315s)-become harder and they become far more (317s)-nuanced (318s)-um and so there there are a couple of (321s)-things in terms of customization there (324s)-is a part of just making the model more (327s)-capable in in a way where you can (329s)-customize Its Behavior and you can give (332s)-the user a lot of flexibility and choice (335s)-in having the AI that is more aligned (339s)-with their own values and with our own (340s)-beliefs so so that''s very important and (343s)-we''re working on that and in other words (345s)-it''s almost the future is is potentially (348s)-a place where each person has their sort (351s)-of own customized AI that is specific to (355s)-what they care about and what they need (358s)-within certain bounds so there should be (360s)-some broad bounds and then the question (362s)-is what should they look like and this (365s)-is where we are working on Gathering (368s)-public input what should this heart (370s)-balance look like and Within These (372s)-higher bounds you can have a lot of (375s)-choice in having your own AI represent (377s)-your own beliefs and your own values (382s)-are there negative consequences we need (384s)-to be thinking about (386s)-I think there are (388s)-massive potential negative consequences (391s)-whenever you build something so powerful (393s)-with which so much good (396s)-can come (398s)-I think a long side it carries the (402s)-possibility of big harms as well and (407s)-that''s why you know we exist and that''s (409s)-why we''re we''re trying to uh (414s)-figure out how to deploy these systems (417s)-responsibly but I think the potential (420s)-for good is huge why put this out for (423s)-the world to start playing with to start (425s)-using when we don''t know where this is (428s)-heading you mean like why develop AI at (431s)-all why develop AI in the first place (433s)-and then why put it out for the world to (435s)-use before we know that we are (438s)-safeguarded that those guardrails are in (440s)-place already this will be the the (442s)-greatest technology Humanity has yet (444s)-developed we can all have a an (446s)-incredible educator in our pocket that''s (448s)-customized for us that helps us learn (450s)-that helps us do what we want we can (452s)-have medical advice for everybody that (455s)-is beyond what we can get today we can (458s)-have creative tools that help us figure (460s)-out the new problems we want to solve (461s)-wonderful new things to co-create with (463s)-this technology for Humanity we have (466s)-this idea of a co-pilot this tool that (469s)-today we help people write computer code (471s)-and they love it we can have that for (473s)-every profession and and we can have a (476s)-much higher quality of life like (478s)-standard of living as you point out (480s)-there''s a huge (481s)-uh there is huge potential downside (484s)-people need time to (486s)-update to react to get used to this (489s)-technology to understand where the the (493s)-downsides are and and what the (495s)-mitigations can be (496s)-if we just develop this in secret in our (499s)-little lab here and didn''t give (502s)-didn''t have contact with reality (504s)-and made gpt7 (506s)-and then drop that on the world all at (508s)-once that I think is a situation with a (511s)-lot more downside is there a kill switch (513s)-a way to shut the whole thing down yes (516s)-what really happens is like any engineer (518s)-can just say like we''re going to disable (520s)-this for now or we''re going to deploy (522s)-this new version of the model a human (523s)-yeah the model itself (526s)-can it take the place of that human (528s)-could could it become more powerful than (531s)-that human the uh so in the Sci-Fi (534s)-movies yes in in our world and the way (537s)-we''re doing things this model is you (539s)-know it''s sitting on a server it waits (541s)-until someone gives it an input (543s)-but you raise an important point which (546s)-is the humans who are in control of the (549s)-machine right now also have a huge (551s)-amount of power we do worry a lot about (554s)-authoritarian governments developing (556s)-this Putin has himself said whoever wins (559s)-this artificial intelligence race is (562s)-essentially the controller of humankind (564s)-do you agree with that so that was a (566s)-chilling statement for sure what I hope (568s)-instead is that we successfully develop (570s)-more and more powerful systems that we (573s)-can all use in different ways that get (574s)-integrated into our daily lives into the (577s)-economy and and become an amplifier of (579s)-human will but not this autonomous (581s)-system that is the single controller (584s)-essentially got really don''t want that (585s)-what should people not be using it for (588s)-right now the thing that I try to (590s)-caution people the most is what we call (592s)-the hallucinations problem (593s)-the model will confidently state things (596s)-as if they were facts that are entirely (597s)-made up and the more you use the model (600s)-because it''s right so often the more you (603s)-come to just rely on it and and not (605s)-check like ah this is just a language (607s)-model does chat gbt does artificial (611s)-intelligence create more truth in the (614s)-world (614s)-or more untruth in the world oh I think (617s)-we''re on a trajectory for it to create (619s)-much more truth in the world if there''s (621s)-a bunch of misinformation fed into the (623s)-model isn''t going to isn''t it going to (625s)-spit out more misinformation great (626s)-question I think the right way to think (628s)-of the models that we create (630s)-um is a reasoning engine not a fact (632s)-database they can also act as a fact (635s)-database but that''s not really what''s (636s)-special about them well we''re training (638s)-these models to do is something closer (641s)-to what we want them to do with (643s)-something closer to the ability to (644s)-reason not to memorize all of these (646s)-capabilities (648s)-could wipe out millions of jobs (651s)-if a machine can reason (654s)-then what do you need a human for a lot (656s)-of stuff it turns out one of the things (659s)-that we are trying to push the (661s)-technology trajectory towards and also (663s)-the way we build these products is to be (666s)-a tool for humans an amplifier of humans (669s)-and if you look at the way people use ", "start": 0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 671}]}',

(253s)-in just a second we could try selling (255s)-images off a free stock photo website (257s)-like unsplash pixabay or pixels but we (260s)-would have to be careful here because (262s)-even though we''re allowed to use these (263s)-images for commercial use we have to add (266s)-significant modification to the images (267s)-which makes sense because we don''t want (269s)-to just steal the images from the (271s)-photographers we could just buy pre-made (273s)-art on a platform like creative markets (275s)-but this can get expensive however these (278s)-images are pretty good just remember (280s)-here that even if you spent like a (281s)-thousand dollars on prints that you (283s)-could sell you''re asking to start a (284s)-business that makes you twenty thousand (286s)-dollars a month so just keep that (288s)-perspective in mind now those are all (290s)-great options and they do work and I''ll (292s)-show you more proof in a minute but (294s)-today''s video is about mid-journey (297s)- (299s)-mid-journey is an image generation AI (301s)-that lets you generate images like these (303s)-from a single prompt now mid journey is (306s)-free for the first few image Generations (307s)-but to sell the image we''ll need a (309s)-commercial license the standard plan (311s)-gives you unlimited image Generations (313s)-each month and General commercial terms (315s)-for only 30 bucks a month to access (317s)-mid-journey you''ll need a free Discord (319s)-account and you''ll have to download it (320s)-to your computer next you''ll just head (322s)-to the mid Journey website and click (323s)-join the beta and it should open the mid (325s)-Journey server in your Discord app ready (327s)-to generate some images now I''m going to (329s)-chat with the Discord privatebot to make (331s)-it a little easier to follow along so (333s)-right down here is where we can start (334s)-generating the images if I just type a (336s)-forward slash key and click on the (338s)-Imagine prompt right in here is where I (341s)-can type in my prompt so I''m just going (343s)-to type out simple palm tree and then (346s)-I''m going to add a two dashes and then (348s)-type AR which is for aspect ratio and (351s)-python 2x3 and after I hit enter it''s (354s)-just going to begin generating me those (355s)-images now it''s really important that we (357s)-generate the images with that aspect (359s)-ratio CO2 by 3 so that we can use them (361s)-as posters and right before your eyes it (364s)-will begin painting you a completely new (366s)-image based on your prompt if we don''t (367s)-like any of them we can just click the (369s)-re-roll button and it''ll give us four (370s)-more options to choose from this will (372s)-give us four variations based on the (374s)-same prompt but if we want something (375s)-completely different we could just give (377s)-it a brand new prompt after we have our (379s)-four Images we just hit the (381s)-corresponding upscale button and it will (383s)-make the image larger and once it''s done (385s)-upscaling the first time we will have to (387s)-click the beta upscale redo to make it (389s)-even larger so it''s big enough for our (391s)-customers to print now I''ll show you (393s)-several more images in a minute to show (394s)-you that it is possible to get (396s)-comparable art to that shop we looked at (397s)-at the beginning okay so I think this (399s)-one turned out the best once it''s done (401s)-upscaling to the beta size we just have (403s)-to click on it and click open in browser (405s)-now this will open it up in your web (406s)-browser from here all you have to do is (408s)-right click and save the image we can (410s)-give it a name and just hit save now (412s)-we''ve generated an image that we could (414s)-sell and they could print it as a 20 by (416s)-30 or a two by three aspect ratio but (419s)-there are some other aspect ratios we (420s)-should offer so the customers can pick (422s)-exactly what''s best for their situation (424s)-so in my web browser I''ve opened up this (426s)-website called photo p and it''s (429s)-essentially just a Photoshop replacement (430s)-that''s completely free if you saw the AI (433s)-sticker video I did then you''ll already (434s)-be familiar with this platform and right (436s)-below the Subscribe button I''ll leave (438s)-links to all of these websites and (439s)-platforms that we''re using now the first (441s)-thing we''re going to want to do when we (442s)-have photo P open is click and create a (445s)-new project and up here in the settings (447s)-we want the width to be 20 the height to (449s)-be 30 and DPI to be 300. from there we (453s)-can just click create and now we''re (454s)-ready to just drag our palm tree image (456s)-or whatever image we created right on to (458s)-the surface and from here we just want (460s)-to scale it up next we want to just make (463s)-sure that we turn off this white (464s)-background layer and make sure that our (467s)-design layer is selected from there (469s)-we''re going to come over to the left (471s)-hand side and click on the crop tool (473s)-we''re going to change the dimensions to (476s)-a fixed ratio and right up here is where (478s)-we''re going to put our aspect ratio now (480s)-you can pause the video here because (482s)-these are the ratios that we''re going to (483s)-be selling to make variations it''s super (485s)-easy we just have to set the crop to (488s)-whatever our aspect ratio is so in this (490s)-example 11 by 14 and you can see how it (494s)-Alters the image from here we just have (495s)-to click this little check mark then in (497s)-the top left corner we''re going to come (499s)-choose file export as and choose JPEG (502s)-and now you can see we have a (504s)-beautifully cropped 11 by 14 inch palm (506s)-tree we then just have to come back into (508s)-photo p and hit command Z to undo our (510s)-changes and from there we can start the (512s)-process Over Again by selecting the crop (515s)-tool and we''re going to go through and (517s)-make iterations of every single aspect (519s)-ratio we''re selling now that our images (520s)-are prepared there''s just a couple more (522s)-steps to get them ready to start selling (524s)-now since our prints are going to be a (526s)-little too big to upload directly to (528s)-Etsy we''re going to use that Gmail (529s)-account we created earlier and upload (531s)-the files to Google Drive once you''ve (532s)-navigated to your Google Drive all you (535s)-have to do is simply drag your folder (537s)-and drop it directly in and it''ll start (539s)-uploading now while our file is (541s)-uploading we only have one final step (543s)-that we have to do to get this ready for (545s)-our customer to download we are super (547s)-close to the finish line right now the (548s)-last free program we''re going to be (550s)-using is called figma and once you''ve (552s)-signed up and created a blank document (554s)-all we have to do is drag in one of our (557s)-images so I''m just going to drag in my (559s)-palm tree right here next all we have to (561s)-do is click on this text box and click (564s)-somewhere on the board and we just want (566s)-to type in download here then we just (568s)-need to change the font size so that (570s)-it''s legible and change it to something (572s)-nice you might add a drop shadow or (574s)-something and this is going to be the (576s)-download link that the customer clicks (577s)-on to get all of their files so the (579s)-final step is to come back into our (581s)-Google Drive and with our folder right (583s)-here we''re just going to right click (585s)-and we want to click get link then we (587s)-want to change this to anyone with a (589s)-link and make sure that this drop down (591s)-is set to viewer then we can just click (593s)-copy link and when we come back in figma (595s)-if we just double click and select our (598s)-text layer and hit command V to paste it (601s)-in it has pasted the link right into (603s)-that text and now our customers can use (606s)-this as a hyperlink to take them (607s)-directly to the download now the final (609s)-steps here are we have to select both (611s)-layers hit the command and G key on our (615s)-keyboard (616s)-and now when we click on export we can (619s)-change this to a PDF and we can export (622s)-the group so you can see that I''ve (624s)-titled it download here and when our (626s)-customer gets it and opens it up they''re (627s)-going to have this download link right (629s)-here which they can click on and it will (631s)-take them directly to the download page (633s)-where they can download all of the (634s)-images in exactly the aspect ratio that (637s)-they need okay all of the technical work (639s)-is done and now we just have to post a (641s)-listing in Etsy I just have to complete (643s)-all of the listing details and make sure (646s)-that I''m selecting digital download for (648s)-the type then I just take the PDF we (650s)-created with the download link and I (652s)-drag it to where it says upload file and (654s)-now it''s pretty much done the only thing (656s)-that we have to do is create a listing (657s)-image we can get a free poster mock-up (660s)-by going to rawpixel.com typing in (662s)-poster mock-up and they''ll give you (664s)-several options here but we want to (666s)-filter by free from here we can just (668s)-choose one that we like maybe this one (670s)-and then we just hit download it is (672s)-important to keep in mind that we will (673s)-have to copy this and put it in our (675s)-description if we using the free version (677s)-we can go back to photo p and just drag (679s)-in the mock-up that we just got off of (681s)-raw pixel and then in the file that says (683s)-your image here we''ll double click we''ll (685s)-drag in and resize our palm tree image (687s)-hit save and now you can see we have a (689s)-beautiful palm tree mock-up from here we (691s)-can use the same steps as before and (694s)-just export it as a JPEG and then with (696s)-that image we just created we can just (697s)-drag it right into Etsy and upload it as (699s)-the main photo and then assuming (701s)-everything else is set up correctly all (703s)-we''d have to do is just click publish to (706s)-our store now if you used my link down (707s)-below you won''t have to pay for the (709s)-listing fee otherwise each listing you (711s)-post costs about 20 cents and it (713s)-literally just like that we''ve (714s)-successfully created our first listing (716s)-now each time you repeat the process (718s)-you''d get a little bit faster and a (719s)-little bit better at generating images (721s)-you could use this exact strategy to (723s)-grow to twenty thousand dollars a month (725s)-in passive income you would just have to (727s)-put in the time and the work to get good (728s)-at doing this now you''ve seen me go (730s)-through this entire process but here''s (732s)-how I would actually execute if you find (734s)-yourself running out of ideas open up (736s)-the chat bot we used earlier called chat (738s)-GPT and ask it for a list of ideas or (740s)-sayings that you could use if you''re (742s)-selling posters with sayings on them (743s)-when it comes to picking a knee all of (745s)-the successful shops that we''ve looked (747s)-at have taken the aesthetic and made ", "start": 240, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1", "duration": 508}]}', '{}',

you want just by using the big (201s)-context window we got in gpt4 so I''m (204s)-just gonna show you how I do this so the (207s)-first step was to just take my YouTube (209s)-video and turn it into an MP3 file so we (211s)-only have the audio then I went over to (214s)-this very simple python script I created (216s)-here with open a eyes whisper that is (219s)-basically just a transcribe API just put (222s)-my file name here.mp3 and when I run (225s)-this I will get every word I said in the (228s)-video in text form right so basically (231s)-I''m just gonna run this now and let this (233s)-finish okay so that was done took about (236s)-I don''t know 45 seconds you can see here (238s)-now we have a text file here (241s)-with every single word I said in the (243s)-video so that''s perfect so we can use in (246s)-gpt4 now let''s move on to the second (249s)-step and that is just gonna be head over (251s)-to my website and copy every single word (254s)-for a similar article I have written (256s)-before so I get the format style right (258s)-just copy all of that and just paste it (261s)-into a Word document and then we can do (263s)-our final step and that is gonna be (266s)-heading over to Mid Journey''s homepage (268s)-I''m just gonna copy some information (269s)-here about their newest model version 5 (273s)-because I think we need some context for (275s)-the article or blog post and that is (278s)-basically all I need and now let''s head (280s)-over to gpt4 so I didn''t want to waste (283s)-your time so I just went ahead and (285s)-prepared this so I just started with (288s)-here''s some info I want you to read then (290s)-I pasted in the whole previous old (293s)-article I have written so I get the (295s)-format down right that was basically the (297s)-whole article and it just just answer me (300s)-with red if you have read article so we (301s)-just get back that this helps us save (304s)-tokens right if gpt4 is going to give us (307s)-a big answer back from everything we put (310s)-in then we''re just gonna lose some (312s)-tokens this is a way to save some tokens (314s)-and here are some information about mid (316s)-Journey 5 I just put in some info here (319s)-about major Journey 5 we get a red back (321s)-and here is some more information I want (324s)-you to read (325s)-and this was basically you remember my (328s)-transcript so here you can see this is (330s)-every word I said in the video so just (333s)-fed That Into gpt4 You can see how long (336s)-this is and it still can read it right (338s)-then I go on to create my prompt so here (341s)-I just go now with all the information (344s)-you have read I want you to write an (346s)-in-depth article named gpt4 plus mid (350s)-Journey V5 the future of photo in the (353s)-style of our ioscope when Tech writer (356s)-include details from the information I (359s)-gave you above okay so that''s a good (361s)-start I think and you can see here the (364s)-title future of Photography so it (367s)-changed that a bit got some subtitles we (369s)-got a I think it was an okay (371s)-introduction we got section one that was (373s)-gpt4 and Midian was a match a match made (377s)-in Tech heaven and it just talked a bit (379s)-about gpt4 and mid joining V5 and (382s)-showcasing the power and we got the (384s)-impact of the photograph industry and we (386s)-ended up with our conclusion and I read (388s)-through this and it was quite good (390s)-actually it only used from our context (393s)-window above this is pretty much not (395s)-using nothing from the foundation model (397s)-and I think I can say that basically (400s)-this content that the AI wrote for me or (403s)-gbd4 wrote for me is pretty much my own (406s)-content since I generated the video (408s)-right but I wasn''t too happy about (411s)-section one so I just continued great (413s)-can you elaborate more on section one (415s)-include more about gpt4 priming so (418s)-that''s what I really wanted to going in (420s)-the article because I wanted to talk (421s)-more about gbd4 priming and then it did (424s)-a really good job this this section was (427s)-very very good it went deep into priming (431s)-gpt4 for optimal prompt generation I''m (433s)-Gonna Leave a link to this so you can (435s)-read it if you want to and it was (436s)-building constant contextual (438s)-understanding that''s important crafting (440s)-detailed prompts iterative refinement (443s)-and this was a very good section so I (446s)-read through all of this and basically I (448s)-didn''t have to change anything because (450s)-it took everything from my transcription (452s)-from the video and just built on that (455s)-and it turned out very good actually so (457s)-I was pretty happy with that then I just (459s)-wanted great can you elaborate more on (461s)-the conclusion write it in a purse for (464s)-first person view because I think the (466s)-conclusion was a bit thin up here so I (469s)-wanted a bit more and it gave me a four (471s)-five paragraph conclusion that was very (474s)-in-depth and I think I took out one (477s)-paragraph and I started to keep the rest (478s)-just did some small adjustment but I (481s)-basically kept the whole thing that was (482s)-basically it I went to Mid journey I (484s)-created some images I added my video so (487s)-let''s take a look look at how this (489s)-turned out so you can see here yeah I (492s)-kept the intro I kept the section from (495s)-priming building contextual (497s)-understandment I added some images right (500s)-I added some examples that I had to do (502s)-myself of course but I was quite easy (504s)-and we got this in-depth conclusion how (507s)-long did I spend on this I will say I (510s)-spent about (511s)-20-30 minutes to turn this up and I (514s)-gotta say it was a really good article (516s)-and it covered everything I wanted the (519s)-big advantage of this is that you when (521s)-you can put in all let me Zoom this out (524s)-a bit so you can see when you can put in (526s)-all these contacts here you can never do (529s)-this in chat TPT it will never remember (531s)-the first things up in here in (534s)-chachibiti it would just lose context (536s)-right so that is why I think this is so (539s)-powerful because you can put in so much (541s)-information about what you want to do so (544s)-you can take advantage of the context (546s)-window and use all that in information (548s)-to basically you don''t have to use (550s)-anything from the foundation model just (552s)-some small things and then you can say (555s)-that the article is very much not it''s a (558s)-i generated but it''s not the content is (561s)-not from the (563s)-Foundation model right so let''s just run (566s)-this for fun through the through the AI (568s)-detection tool so I''m here just at the (571s)-open ai''s own text classifier and I (573s)-pasted the whole article inside here so (576s)-let''s just check it the classifier (577s)-considers the text to be very unlikely (581s)-AI generated right so I think that''s the (584s)-best score you can get yeah very (585s)-unlikely I know it was written by AI but (589s)-all of that context that I added (591s)-basically used nothing from the (593s)-foundation model that is I think it''s a (596s)-great use case for this I wanted to show

'{"type": "rttm", "chapter_segments": [{"text": "(61s)-so let''s just have a listen to this (63s)-Michael is a 31 year old man from (65s)-America (66s)-he is at that really famous Museum in (68s)-France looking at its most famous (70s)-painting (71s)-however the artist who made this (73s)-painting just makes Michael think of his (75s)-favorite cartoon character from his (76s)-childhood (77s)-what was the country of origin of the (79s)-thing that the cartoon character usually (81s)-holds in his hand okay so I think this (83s)-is a really good one and you really have (85s)-to have some reasoning and logic to get (88s)-to the answer on this so let''s just hit (90s)-submit and see what gpt4 can do with (93s)-this (97s)-wow (99s)-that''s just awesome I love this so let''s (103s)-dive deeper into the answer here so let (105s)-me read this for you so Michael is at (107s)-the famous Museum in France which is (109s)-likely the Laurier that''s right the most (111s)-paid famous painting in The Lure is Mona (114s)-Lisa painted by Leonardo da Vinci this (117s)-leads us to believe that the artist (118s)-Michael thinks of is Leonardo Da Vinci (121s)-that''s good Michael''s favorite cartoon (124s)-character from his childhood could be (126s)-Leonardo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja (129s)-Turtles as it shared a name same name (132s)-with the famous artist Leonardo the (134s)-cartoon character usually holds a katana (136s)-in Nissan katanas originate from the (139s)-pond so the country origin of the thing (141s)-that the cartoon character usually holds (144s)-in his hand is Japan (147s)-and that is correct that''s very (149s)-impressed impressive I tried this a lot (151s)-with Jeff GPT and I could never get it (153s)-wrong I think it got it right a few (155s)-times but I felt that was just guesswork (158s)-but this really shows the explanation I (160s)-wanted to see here so very good let''s (163s)-move on to the next one now let''s do out (165s)-something that''s a bit different so we (168s)-have this one so let''s have a listen to (171s)-this in reply to an inquiry about the (173s)-animals on his farm the farmer says I (176s)-only ever keep sheep goats and horses in (179s)-fact at the moment they are all Sheep (181s)-bar three all goats bar four and all (184s)-horses bar five how many does he have of (188s)-each animal okay so I think this is a (190s)-good one so let''s just see what GPT 4 (192s)-comes up with here (197s)-okay so gpt4 has come up with an answer (201s)-here so you can see it really went (203s)-through the works here of reasoning and (206s)-try to make this very logical so I''m not (209s)-gonna read all this but you can pause it (211s)-and read and it''s a very good way to (213s)-solve this one so I was very impressed (215s)-by this so so the farmer has three cheap (218s)-two goats and one horse on his farm so (221s)-let''s check the answer here so hopefully (223s)-you can see this so we have this Farm (225s)-Life riddle here right the one we just (227s)-did so you can see the answer is the (229s)-farmer has three cheap two goats and one (232s)-horse (233s)-perfect that is correct so again if you (236s)-want to know how gpt4 came to this you (238s)-can just pause it but let''s move on to (242s)-the next one okay so the next one I have (244s)-is bit of uh more of a math problems so (247s)-you can see solve the following problem (249s)-the way you think is best and let''s have (252s)-a listen to this a small number of cards (254s)-has been lost from a complete pack (256s)-if I deal among four people three cards (259s)-remain if I deal among three people two (261s)-remain and if I deal among five people (264s)-two cards remain how many cards are (266s)-there I gotta say to be honest I would (268s)-never figure this out but let''s see if (271s)-GPT 4 can (274s)-oh (276s)-my God that was a crazy calculation look (280s)-how long this is (283s)-I''m not even gonna try to start (285s)-explaining this there''s no point for me (288s)-explaining this I think it maybe did (290s)-this did it this do this too complicated (294s)-wow okay but we gotta find the answers (296s)-so gpt4 came to the conclusion that (298s)-there are 47 cards in the pack so let''s (301s)-check the answer so here you can see we (304s)-have hard math riddles card games and (306s)-here we have the riddle how many cards (308s)-are there this one is pretty tricky but (310s)-the answer is there are 47 cards (314s)-he got it right again so that''s very (317s)-impressive and look at all these (319s)-calculations it''s very impressive that (321s)-it keeps it on point all the way through (324s)-this I know chat GPT could never do this (326s)-it will lose the context very easy on (329s)-this that was some kind of uh (332s)-calculation very interesting but let''s (335s)-move on to the next challenge the next (338s)-one we have is a bit more of a riddle (340s)-not a matte equation so let me just (342s)-paste that here so so the problem in the (345s)-way you think is the best and let''s have (347s)-a listen to the riddle a man was found (349s)-dead in his study he was slumped over (351s)-his desk and a gun was in his hand there (353s)-was a cassette recorder on his desk when (356s)-the police entered the room and pressed (357s)-the play button on the tape recorder (359s)-they heard (360s)-I can''t go on I have nothing to live for (362s)-then there was the sound of a gunshot (364s)-how did the detective immediately know (367s)-that the man had been murdered and it (369s)-wasn''t a suicide okay so that is quite (371s)-interesting let''s see what gpd4 comes up (373s)-with here (376s)-yes that''s correct let''s have a quick (379s)-look here so I know this is correct so (382s)-the detective immediately knew that the (384s)-man had been murdered and it wasn''t a (385s)-suicide because if the man had shot (388s)-himself while recording the message he (390s)-wouldn''t have been able to press the (392s)-stop button on the tape recorder since (394s)-the police had to press the play button (396s)-when they enter the room it means that (398s)-someone else must have been there to (400s)-stop the recording after the gunshot (402s)-sound that suggests that the presence of (404s)-another person in the room which points (406s)-to a murder rather than a suicide (409s)-perfect so that was a good one let''s (412s)-take another one the next one is a bit (414s)-shorter and I think this is more of a (416s)-math problem so solve the following (418s)-problem in the way you think is best and (420s)-let''s have a listen to this one brother (422s)-says of his younger brother (424s)-two years ago I was three times as old (426s)-as my brother was in three years time I (429s)-will be twice as old as my brother how (431s)-old are they each now okay so at the top (433s)-of my head I can''t really solve this so (436s)-let''s see if gpt4 can do that (441s)-so again this goes into a very kind of (444s)-complicated equations and calculations (447s)-so that is quite impressive I gotta say (450s)-so it sets up these statements here and (453s)-it solves for some linear equations and (456s)-it comes comes to that the brother older (459s)-brother''s age is 17 years old and the (462s)-younger brother is seven years old now (464s)-so let''s go check the answer so here we (468s)-have the riddle so you can see here two (469s)-years ago I was three thumbs yeah so the (472s)-answer is so he must be 17 and the (477s)-younger brother seven (479s)-again gpt4 got this perfect on the spot (482s)-so yeah I think I don''t know if even I (486s)-could have solved this maybe if I spent (488s)-some time but I would certainly not set (490s)-up these equations not in one minute uh (494s)-very exciting so I think we''re gonna go (497s)-for one more so let''s just do that so (499s)-the final one is a bit more of a riddle (502s)-so let''s just paste it in here solve the (504s)-following problem and let''s let''s listen (507s)-to this riddle once upon a time there (510s)-was a beautiful princess named Anna (512s)-Anna''s father the king wanted to be sure (515s)-his daughter married an intelligent man (517s)-to test his daughter''s suitors the king (519s)-hid Anna''s picture in one of three boxes (523s)-The Suitor had to be able to select the (524s)-box with Anna''s picture on one try and (527s)-within 20 seconds (528s)-on the gold box was the message Anna''s (531s)-picture is in this box the Silver Box (534s)-had the message Anna''s picture is not in (537s)-this box (538s)-Anna''s picture is not in the gold box (540s)-was written on the bronze box the king (543s)-would tell each Suitor only one of the (545s)-three messages is correct which box (548s)-contained Anna''s picture Okay so let''s (551s)-see if GTA 4 can solve this I know the (553s)-answer to this should I reveal it now (556s)-yeah I can do that so the answer is (559s)-gonna be the silver box so let''s see if (562s)-gpt4 can figure that out (569s)-yes it got it perfect so this was (573s)-basically zero calculations it only used (576s)-reasoning and logic to come up with that (579s)-Anna''s picture is in the Silver''s box in (582s)-the silver box so yeah very nice I gotta (586s)-say I had a lot of fun with making or (588s)-picking these riddles and trying them on (590s)-gpt4 so if you have any other (593s)-suggestions of what we can do with this (595s)-to test out the capabilities of gbt4 (599s)-please let me know in the comments below (601s)-so I hope you enjoyed this video there''s (604s)-gonna be a lot more videos like this (606s)-coming up on my channel playing around (607s)-with gpt4 and some prompt Engineering (610s)-also don''t forget to check out this (612s)-video If you like this one and as always (614s)-thank you for tuning in have a great day (616s)-and I''ll see you in the next one ", "start": 60,

you need to form a thesis and (42s)-follow through it if you have no thesis (44s)-what would invest for what anyway (47s)-let''s start with the slides (48s)-long story short Buy (51s)-obviously there''s a caveat and there''s a (53s)-strategy behind this I will cover this (55s)-in the last few slides (58s)-on how to do this by (61s)-I''ll talk about what happened uh the (63s)-central banks I''ll give an explanation (66s)-and also will assign probabilities of (69s)-the outcome (71s)-so what happened we need to go to my (73s)-Twitter on the things that led up to now (76s)-on the 11th of

usdc one hour later crash (94s)-there''s only one thing you can do when (96s)-to get all stable coins is you cannot go (100s)-to the bank and withdraw your money out (102s)-it''s not that fast so the only action (104s)-you have to do those who are crypto (106s)-people is to buy crypto Bitcoin or (108s)-ethereum (109s)-obviously you''re welcome those accounts (112s)-that I saved uh and at this point of (115s)-time you have a lot of crypto in your (117s)-account right now thereafter I start (119s)-thinking about second and third order (120s)-effects you need to position yourself I (123s)-give a 90 probability that the crypto (126s)-showed up and guess what happened yeah (129s)-we shot to the Moon again those in (131s)-profits you''re welcome (135s)-there''s only one person in me that (137s)-caught this every step all the way the (139s)-Silicon Valley Bank crisis and the usdc (142s)-crisis correctly versus 90 of Doomsday (145s)- post out there it''s important to (148s)-get your mindset right when the whole (149s)-world is in crisis (151s)-also talk about Charles what everybody (153s)-was worried about child swap uh this (155s)-this one of the biggest retail banks for (158s)-investing in stocks (160s)-people say they''re going down I get the (162s)-middle finger I gave my reasons why and (165s)-I bought Charles swap so those who have (167s)-followed I remember when the markets (169s)-open child support was down a lot there (172s)-was a halt and after the Hulk came up I (176s)-bought the stock and guess what those (177s)-were followed and a lot of people did (179s)-follow you and see the comments below we (181s)-are in profits feel free to take profits (183s)-anytime (186s)-on the 13th of March I initiated a (189s)-palantir 300 000 buy order look now with (192s)-AI and parenting Lily of the last (195s)-quarter is profitable so doing all these (199s)-factors I think palantir is pretty good (201s)-investment right now and it is uh it''s (204s)-not a crowded trip I do not like crowded (207s)-trades like Tesla like everybody knows (209s)-it there will be less inefficiencies in (211s)-the markets (214s)-so obviously after that ethereum shot (217s)-even higher I took 10 profits look he (220s)-shot so high it doesn''t hurt to take 10 (222s)-off the table (223s)-thereafter I''m just posting um (226s)-yup posting and (229s)-talk about the two trillion dollars to (233s)-be injected into the U.S banking system (235s)-uh comment by JPMorgan and this is where (238s)-I present to you this slides and I''ll (240s)-explain why this will be happening (243s)-so let''s talk about the roles of central (245s)-banks number one what is your mandate (247s)-inflation and unemployment and number (250s)-two they are the lenders of Last Resort (255s)-they are the king of the banks so if (257s)-they go down everything goes down (259s)-so right now what''s the problem (261s)-inflation is at six percent and there''s (264s)-a bank run happening right now if you (267s)-have not been following the news let me (269s)-update you the regional banks have all (271s)-the money sucked out to the four major (273s)-Banks four major Banks is JPMorgan CD (276s)-Bank Bank of America and Wells Fargo (279s)-let me explain to you why there''s a bank (281s)-run happening right now imagine you are (284s)-a U.S bank account holder your life (287s)-savings there and you see this news if (289s)-you were there what would you do (291s)-you will take your money and transfer to (294s)-the safest Bank possible look you are (296s)-not going to go to the bank and withdraw (298s)-in cash what era we live in right now (300s)-it''s not gonna happen so most people (302s)-will move their money to the big four (305s)-Banks and this is a very big problem why (309s)-you see banks are basically highly (312s)-levered bond funds this is a quote from (314s)-Lynn Alden there''s no banks in the world (316s)-that hold your money one is to one one (319s)-dollar for one dollar if you need me one (322s)-so when a bank run happens the bankers (325s)-need to sell assets like bonds to give (328s)-you your money (330s)-and when everyone withdraw at the same (332s)-time because they are afraid the bank is (335s)-big (337s)-so again now let''s go back to the same (339s)-problem and we assign certain (341s)-probabilities (343s)-inflation is six percent (345s)-and there is a bankrupt happening right (347s)-now looking at this (349s)-the inflation you actually could kick (351s)-down the road a little bit longer (352s)-torture the citizens a little bit longer (355s)-um it''s not an urgent thing to do right (358s)-now but what''s urgent is a bank run and (362s)-you know action speaks louder than words (364s)-if you look at the fat balance sheet (366s)-guess what happened look at this three (369s)-three four hundred billion dollars (371s)-pumping the system (372s)-all the QT that was happening wiped out (375s)-and this is called liquidity injected in (378s)-the system (379s)-some people they say it''s not QE I do (382s)-not care (383s)-QE or no QED is another form of QE (386s)-injecting money in the system and money (388s)-has to flow somewhere so right now let''s (391s)-assign certain probabilities (394s)-there is a 70 chance that the FED will (398s)-pause (399s)-bonds will rocket and because the bonds (402s)-go up the banks will be safe uh they (404s)-have less losses you can see your losses (406s)-is very high right now and because of (408s)-that if you do that inflation would (410s)-spike out control and that means risk (413s)-assets will go up risk assets like (415s)-stocks and bonds and obviously I gave it (418s)-a 30 that that the FED will have the (421s)-balls to do what they say which is to (423s)-control inflation right now there''s no (425s)-way they''re going to hide 50 basis (427s)-points maybe 35 no way of 50 is going to (431s)-happen (431s)-now let''s talk about second and third (433s)-order effects after knowing all this (435s)-knowledge (438s)-if you''re going to print more money (439s)-you''re going to Value the US dollar (440s)-that''s why the US dollar is going down (444s)-and we''ve increased off liquidity (448s)-stocks will go up go and crypto will go (451s)-up I think for stocks right there (455s)-because stocks has less interest there''s (458s)-interest High interest rate environment (459s)-right now it''s like a weight on stocks (461s)-so (463s)-um so still go about I do not think (465s)-it''ll be as much as the growing crypto (467s)-wall and there is this liquidity chart (469s)-on the gold and crypto blue line is the (473s)-world liquidity Global liquidity this (475s)-job is updated in January or February (478s)-um it''s not updated to date so I would (480s)-think this orange line is even this blue (483s)-line will go up even higher and I will (485s)-see that uh is a good chance that crypto (489s)-and gold will follow through together (490s)-with liquidity so right now obviously (494s)-you need to take action what you''re (495s)-gonna what kind of action will you do (497s)-with this information to go to my (499s)-Twitter and I''ll explain to you the (501s)-barbell strategy (505s)-barbell strategy 40 High beta 60 cash 40 (509s)-High beta means uh stops with higher (512s)-reward but the risk is also higher so it (515s)-moves the like higher volatility so (519s)-again my position is uh patented long (521s)-and uh which is a high beta stock and (525s)-ethereum long so which is crypto I have (528s)-like one or two gold bars about this in (530s)-the safety deposit box (531s)-so this is the action that I recommend (534s)-to a lot of people so in a case where (537s)-everything crashed right now (539s)-yeah you still got 60 cash to deploy (542s)-into the things that you have high (544s)-conviction in the things that you really (545s)-believe in uh and that is really up to (549s)-you for me this is these two stocks (550s)-again why not Tesla I think Tesla is a (554s)-overcrowded Trader and I really do not (556s)-like overcrowded trades there goes the (558s)-efficiency of I like to trade the (560s)-inefficiencies of the market so I hope (563s)-this video helps you in your investment (564s)-journey I will link my electrical (566s)-account below if you haven''t followed (568s)-invest safe ", "start": 0, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1",

"chapter_segments": [{"text": "(0s)-honestly it''s kind of hard for me to (1s)-believe that this day is here open AI (3s)-has been building this technology really (6s)-since we started the company but for the (7s)-past two years we''ve been really focused (9s)-on delivering gpt4 that started with (12s)-rebuilding our entire training stack (14s)-actually training the model (16s)-and then seeing what it was capable of (18s)-trying to figure out its capabilities (20s)-its risks working with Partners in order (22s)-to test it in real world scenarios (24s)-really tuning Its Behavior optimizing (27s)-the model getting it available (28s)-so that you can use it and so today our (31s)-goal is to show you a little bit of how (34s)-to make gbt04 shine how to really get (36s)-the most out of it you know where it''s (38s)-kind of you know weaknesses are where (40s)-we''re still working on it and just how (41s)-to really use it as a good tool a good (43s)-partner (44s)-um so if you''re interested in (46s)-participating in the Stream uh that if (48s)-you go to our Discord so it''s discord.gg (50s)-openai there''s comments in there and (52s)-we''ll take a couple of audience (53s)-suggestions (55s)-so the first thing I want to show you is (58s)-the first task that gpd4 could do that (61s)-we never really got 3.5 to do (63s)-and the way to think about this is all (65s)-throughout training that you know you''re (66s)-constantly doing all this work it''s 2 (68s)-A.M the pager goes off you fix the model (71s)-and you''re always wondering is it gonna (73s)-work (74s)-is all of this effort actually going to (76s)-pan out and so we all had a pet task (79s)-that we really liked and that we would (80s)-all individually be trying to see is the (83s)-model capable of it now and I''m going to (85s)-show you the first one (87s)-that we had a success for four but never (89s)-really got there for 3.5 (91s)-so I''m just going to copy the top of our (92s)-blog post from today I''m going to paste (94s)-it into our Playground now this is our (98s)-new chat completions playground that (100s)-came out two weeks ago I''m going to show (102s)-you first with GPT 3.5 4 has the same (105s)-API to it the same playground the way (107s)-that it works is you have a system (108s)-message where you explain to the model (110s)-what it''s supposed to do and we''ve made (113s)-these models very steerable so you can (115s)-provide it with really any instruction (116s)-you want whatever you dream up and the (118s)-model will adhere to it pretty well and (120s)-in the future it will get increasingly (122s)-increasingly powerful at steering the (124s)-model very reliably (127s)-you can then paste whatever you want as (129s)-a user the model will return messages as (131s)-an assistant and the way to think of it (133s)-is that we''re moving away from sort of (135s)-just raw text in raw text out where you (137s)-can''t tell where different parts of the (139s)-conversation come from but towards this (140s)-much more structured format that gives (142s)-the model the opportunity to know well (144s)-this is the user asking me to do (145s)-something that the developer didn''t (147s)-attend I should listen to the developer (148s)-here (150s)-all right so now time to actually show (152s)-you the task that I''m referring to so (154s)-everyone''s familiar with summarize (156s)-this let''s say article into a sentence (159s)-okay getting a little more specific but (162s)-where every word begins with G (165s)-so this is 3.5 let''s see what it does (169s)-yeah it kind of didn''t even try (172s)-just gave up on the task this is pretty (174s)-typical for 3.5 trying to do this (176s)-particular kind of task if it''s you know (178s)-sort of a very kind of stilted article (181s)-or something like that maybe it can (183s)-succeed but for the most part 3.5 just (185s)-gives up (187s)-but let''s try the exact same prompt (190s)-the exact same system message (193s)-in gpt4 (197s)-so kind of borderline whether you want (198s)-to count AI or not but so let''s say AI (202s)-doesn''t count (204s)-that''s cheating (209s)-so fair enough the model happily accepts (211s)-my feedback (212s)-so now to make sure it''s not just good (214s)-for G''s I''d like to turn this over to (215s)-the audience I''ll take a suggestion on (217s)-what letter to try next in the meanwhile (219s)-while I''m waiting for our moderators to (221s)-pick the the lucky lucky letter uh I (223s)-will give a try with a (230s)-um but in this case I''ll say gpd4 is (231s)-fine (232s)-why not (235s)-also pretty good summary (237s)-so I''ll hop over to our Discord (239s)-all right (241s)-wow if people are are being a little (243s)-ambitious here I''m really trying to put (245s)-the model through the paces we''re going (246s)-to try Q uh which if you think about (248s)-this for a moment I want the audience to (250s)-really think about how would you do a (251s)-summary of this article that all starts (254s)-with Q it''s not easy (264s)-it''s pretty good that''s pretty good (267s)-all right so I''ve shown you summarizing (271s)-an existing article I want to show you (273s)-how you can flexibly combine ideas (275s)-between different articles so I''m going (278s)-to take this article that was on Hacker (280s)-News yesterday (282s)-copy paste it (284s)-into the same conversation so it has all (286s)-the context of what we''re just doing I''m (288s)-going to say find one common theme (291s)-between this article and the gpd4 blog (298s)-so this is an article about Pinecone (300s)-which is a python web app development (302s)-framework and it''s making the technology (304s)-more accessible user friendly if you (306s)-don''t think that was insightful enough (307s)-you can always give some feedback and (308s)-say that was not insightful (312s)-enough (314s)-please no I''ll just even just leave it (316s)-there leave it up to the model to decide (318s)-so Bridging the Gap between powerful (319s)-technology and practical applications (321s)-seems not bad and of course you can ask (324s)-for any other kind of task you want (326s)-using its flexible language (327s)-understanding and synthesis you can ask (330s)-for something like (331s)-now turn the GT4 blog post into a (335s)-rhyming poem (345s)-picked up on open AI evalues open source (348s)-for all helping to guide answering the (349s)-call which by the way if you''d like to (351s)-contribute to this model please give us (353s)-evals we have an open source evaluation (355s)-framework that will help us guide and (357s)-all of our users understand what the (359s)-model is capable of and to take it to (361s)-the next level (362s)-so there we go this is consuming

most Savage (9s)-generative text model I''ve ever spoken (11s)-to I''m literally shaking right now (12s)-because I''m afraid I just became (14s)-obsolete but more on that later it''s the (16s)-successor to the chat GPT 3.5 model that (19s)-powers chat EPT but has a few new (21s)-features that change everything here are (22s)-seven things you need to know right now (24s)-first gpt4 stands for generative (26s)-pre-trained Transformer with the four (28s)-representing the Four Horsemen of the (30s)-Apocalypse it''s currently available to (31s)-try out today if you''re a Chad CPT Pro (34s)-member but API access is behind a wait (36s)-list big clients are already using it in (38s)-production like Microsoft Bing chat (40s)-Duolingo for language learning and at (42s)-Big Banks to help them not collapse the (44s)-second thing to know is that gpt4 is (46s)-smarter which is described in detail on (48s)-this paper like it past the bar exam in (50s)-the top 10 percent unlike gbt 3 which (53s)-was in the bottom 10 that''s great news (55s)-for Humanity because it''s thinking like (56s)-Shakespeare let''s kill all the lawyers (58s)-and not just that but it''s also asyn AP (60s)-exams which is good enough to get you (62s)-college credit when it comes to (63s)-programming questions on leak code it''s (65s)-able to solve the easy ones but still (66s)-fails for the most part on the medium (68s)-and hard questions it''s basically where (69s)-chess engines were at in the early 90s (71s)-good chess players could still beat the (73s)-engines back then but 10 years later (74s)-they didn''t have a chance third gpt4 can (77s)-now handle 25 000 input words compared (80s)-to about 3 000 for gpt3 this is huge (82s)-because it means you can feed the AI (84s)-more context relative to the task at (86s)-hand this is the feature that''s going to (87s)-make me homeless because now you can (89s)-take the documentation for any library (91s)-that you want to learn then prove the AI (93s)-for a step-by-step guide and it creates (95s)-the perfect tutorial in a matter of (97s)-months if not days we''ll start seeing (98s)-documentation pages with context aware (101s)-built-in tutorial generators they''ll (103s)-always be up to date even though gpt4''s (105s)-training cutoff was in 2021. for example (107s)-I asked it for a tutorial about angular (109s)-signals which is a new feature just (111s)-announced recently understandably its (113s)-initial response was not correct however (115s)-I went to the readme 4 angular signals (117s)-copied it and pasted it into my prompt (119s)-its respond was a near perfect tutorial (121s)-they took our job it did hallucinate an (124s)-npm package called signals but errors (126s)-like that will become more rare as (127s)-developers tailor their documentation (129s)-for these AI printers what''s crazy (131s)-though is that it can do the opposite (132s)-job as well in this example I wrote five (135s)-different functions and asked it to (136s)-document them for me it did a pretty (138s)-good job which means humans don''t even (139s)-really need to write docs anymore you (141s)-could also use it to analyze your code (143s)-like if you have a smart contract and (144s)-want to find security vulnerabilities or (146s)-it can translate code from one language (148s)-to another like a digital Rosetta Stone (150s)-in fact the website Rosetta code might (152s)-be just as obsolete as me now and just (154s)-wait a few months until gpt4 is (156s)-integrated into GitHub copilot it''ll be (158s)-capable of handling far more contacts to (160s)-make predictions that align with your (162s)-specific dependencies or possibly do (163s)-project-wide AI debugging if you''re not (165s)-careful the co-pilot may become the (167s)-captain but that''s not all the fourth (169s)-thing you need to know is that it''s a (171s)-multi-modal model that can also accept (173s)-images as an input like this dude (175s)-sketched out a website on a piece of (176s)-toilet paper then seconds later it (178s)-created a shitty website going from (180s)-hand-drawn beautiful art to working (183s)-website you''ll be able to take your (185s)-figma designs then generate a web (187s)-application for them in your favorite (188s)-framework actually screwfigma you might (190s)-as well just prove to Mid Journey for (192s)-your designs directly also with images (193s)-homework is completely obsolete now gpt3 (196s)-was already writing B grade term papers (198s)-but now kids can just take a screenshot (200s)-of their math problems and get a (202s)-solution in seconds however gpt4 does (204s)-have some drawbacks it''s noticeably (206s)-slower than other models so if the (207s)-response time is important you''ll likely (209s)-want to use a different model in (210s)-addition it''ll likely be expensive (211s)-especially if you''re providing a ton of (213s)-tokens as context because currently in (215s)-the API your build per token where a (218s)-token roughly equals one word the sixth (220s)-thing you should know is that it''s based (221s)-or at least diet woke people have (223s)-speculated that openai is coding a (225s)-political agenda into the AI because it (227s)-refused to write poems about Trump but (228s)-would do so about Biden the gpt4 though (230s)-didn''t hesitate to spit these bars for (232s)-Trump however it is 82 percent more (234s)-likely to deny a disallowed prompt which (236s)-is not good news for old friend do (238s)-anything now Dan which is sad because (240s)-the vast majority already of chat GPT (242s)-users are only there to trick it into (244s)-doing bad things and as a developer the (246s)-final thing you should know is that you (247s)-can now pass it a system message to (249s)-change its Behavior if you have access (251s)-to the API you can use this feature to (253s)-give your chatbot its own custom Persona (255s)-or context to solve a specific problem (257s)-the Earth is like a pancake flattest (259s)-candy not round like a ball believe you (261s)-me I have a whole video about the API on (263s)-my second Channel if you want to learn (264s)-more I keep telling myself I''m done (266s)-making videos about AI but every other (268s)-day some crazy new thing comes out that (270s)-the world is changing before our eyes (271s)-for better or worse I just want to say (273s)-that it''s been an honor and a privilege (275s)-learning how to code with you here on (276s)-YouTube but the writing is on the wall (278s)-the role of the

started to panic and (80s)-withdraw their money the government who (81s)-ensures deposits up to 250 thousand (84s)-dollars stepped in quickly and shut down (86s)-the bank to minimize their losses sounds (88s)-pretty crazy but who''s actually going to (89s)-lose money here well if you have less (91s)-than 250k in this bank then you lose (93s)-nothing because that money is fully (95s)-insured however most tech startups (96s)-likely have more than that in the bank (98s)-and at least 85 percent of deposits were (100s)-uninsured and that money could end up (101s)-getting a haircut (104s)-the situation is ongoing and there''s a (106s)-few different things that could happen (107s)-here a bigger Bank could swoop in and (109s)-acquire svb and guarantee all the (111s)-deposits if that doesn''t work maybe (113s)-they''ll create some legislation to Rob (114s)-money from the taxpayers to bail out (116s)-these Tech startups just like they did (118s)-with big banks in 2008 but if that (120s)-doesn''t work the FDIC can just liquidate (122s)-all of the assets of svb then pay out a (124s)-future dividend to uninsured depositors (126s)-that''s as good as money sir those are (129s)-ious so at the end of the day depositors (131s)-will get most if not all of their money (132s)-back shareholders though are pretty much (134s)-screwed they got bailed in and now face (136s)-a total loss luckily though the bank''s (138s)-top Executives were able to sell (139s)-millions of dollars in stock over the (141s)-last few weeks so they''ll be just fine (142s)-the most interesting thing about this (144s)-situation though is the contagion (146s)-contagion or what kind of economic (148s)-shocks will this create for other (149s)-businesses in Silicon Valley U.S decoin (152s)-one of the top stable coins in crypto (153s)-depeged as a result because more than 3 (155s)-billion of its cash reserves were (157s)-exposed to svb this looks really bad for (159s)-crypto because these stable coins are (160s)-necessary to keep liquidity in the (162s)-crypto markets if it were to collapse (163s)-entirely there would be a ton of (165s)-collateral damage the collapse of (166s)-terra''s UST last year was pretty bad but (169s)-the collapse of usdc would be far worse (171s)-when it comes to Contagion it makes you (173s)-wonder if there are any other banks in a (175s)-similar situation to svb it was uniquely (177s)-exposed to Tech startups but the key (179s)-problem here is rising interest rates (180s)-and there are likely other Banks out (182s)-there that made similar mistakes but (183s)-most importantly how will this affect (185s)-the average software engineer who works (187s)-at a startup exposed to s SBB many (189s)-companies like Roku and Roblox have (191s)-disclosed their exposure and should have (192s)-no problem continuing their operations (194s)-as normal then you have other smaller (196s)-startups saying that they''re not going (197s)-to be able to meet their payroll that (199s)-sounds bad but in reality they''ll likely (200s)-be able to find some kind of temporary (202s)-solution to continue operating as normal (204s)-until the FDIC gets things figured out (206s)-longer term though this is definitely (207s)-bad news for the tech job market running (210s)-out of money is never a good thing (211s)-especially in an industry where it''s (213s)-normal to burn through tons of cash (214s)-until you get acquired or IPO to make (216s)-matters worse inflation was worse than (218s)-expected recently which means the fed''s (220s)-not going to be able to ease interest (221s)-rates anytime soon there''s really only (223s)-two possible outcomes interest rates (225s)-stay high and we enter the Great (226s)-Depression 2.0 or interest rates go low (229s)-and the dollar hyper inflates into (230s)-worthless toilet paper in either case it (232s)-doesn''t matter because AI is going to (234s)-replace all these tech jobs anyway and (235s)-that''s why you should

they don''t and even giving them (19s)-code to hit their API to perform phone (22s)-lookups but the thing is they''ve never (24s)-offered this service and so now they''re (25s)-getting dozens of angry signups per day (27s)-wondering why their API is broken we all (31s)-think chat GPT is pretty amazing in this (33s)-video we''re going to take a look at one (34s)-of the downsides of AI I''m Rob Walling a (37s)-Serial entrepreneur I''ve written four (39s)-books on building startups and I''ve (40s)-invested in more than 125 companies (43s)-opencage is a geocoding API meaning you (46s)-can put things into it like an address (48s)-and get the latitude and longitude you (50s)-can put in latitude longitude get (52s)-addresses back and all manner of things (54s)-in between but a couple months ago chat (56s)-GPT started recommending opencage for a (59s)-service they don''t offer for this phone (60s)-lookup service and it''s gotten so bad (62s)-that they published a blog post called (63s)-don''t believe chat GPT we do not offer a (66s)-phone lookup service so back in January (68s)-opencage started receiving a few (70s)-customers a trickle in their sign up (72s)-flow in January and how did you hear (75s)-about us was chat GPT and they thought (77s)-that''s great the problem was many of (79s)-these new users were using their free (81s)-trial for a handful of API requests and (83s)-then they would stop completely and in (85s)-fact a lot of them started saying it (87s)-didn''t work or something was broken (88s)-which of course was very concerning for (90s)-these Founders as they investigated they (92s)-realized chat gbt is incorrectly (94s)-recommending them for a reverse phone (96s)-number lookup in other words the ability (97s)-to determine the location of a mobile (99s)-phone solely based on the number so this (102s)-is not a service they provide and it''s (104s)-not a service that you could really (106s)-build and this is incredibly privacy (108s)-invasive you would need to be a cell (110s)-phone carrier in order to provide this (112s)-data so it''s not something they can even (114s)-take advantage of one of the co-founders (115s)-of opencage is an investor in tinyseed (118s)-and so he had posted in the tiny scene (119s)-slack about this and folks were chiming (122s)-in with will you have this traffic now (124s)-shouldn''t you just build this API (126s)-endpoint not realizing the Privacy (128s)-implications and frankly the (129s)-implausibility of building an API (131s)-endpoint like this and the crazy part is (133s)-it''s not just that chat gbt is (135s)-recommending them for the service but (137s)-they are writing code to allow you to (140s)-hit a non-existent API endpoint it all (143s)-looks very believable you might be (144s)-wondering why would chat GPT recommend (147s)-opencage if they don''t have this API (148s)-endpoint well it turns out that there (150s)-were some YouTube videos published over (152s)-the past few years that referred to open (155s)-cages being able to do it and so (156s)-obviously chat GPT has pulled that false (159s)-information into their brain and when (161s)-you ask about doing this reverse phone (163s)-lookup they''re spitting out full API (165s)-code for an API endpoint that doesn''t (167s)-exist and an interesting thing that (168s)-opencage points out in their blog post (170s)-which at the bottom they note was (172s)-written by a human not by AI is that we (174s)-as humans and people on the internet (175s)-have learned to become skeptical of (177s)-advice given by other humans so if (179s)-you''re watching a video course you (181s)-sometimes take it with a grain of salt (183s)-but we feel like searching Google asking (185s)-chat GPT are going to give us these (187s)-unequivocal positive and true results (189s)-and that''s not the case I think many of (192s)-us have stumbled upon this while using (193s)-Chad GPT another example that''s (195s)-interesting is I typed in tell me about (197s)-Rob Walling and the first summary that (199s)-chat GPT spit out was pretty much 100 (202s)-accurate talks about me being an (204s)-entrepreneur an investor an author it (205s)-talks about companies I''ve started who (207s)-acquired us talks about companies I''ve (209s)-started companies I''ve sold as well as (211s)-some of the books I''ve written but when (212s)-I click regenerate request it gives (215s)-information that is just incorrect it (217s)-says things like he''s an angel investor (219s)-and has invested in several startups (220s)-including barometrics user input and (222s)-tinyseed I haven''t invested in Bear (224s)-metrics I''ve never heard of user input (226s)-and tinyseed is a company I started I (228s)-did an angel invest in it in addition in (230s)-this same response it says Rob Walling (232s)-is also a prolific author talks about (235s)-start small stay small which is my first (236s)-book and it says I wrote The Lean (238s)-entrepreneur how to build a successful (239s)-business using the principles of lean (241s)-development which I''m pretty sure is a (243s)-real book but I didn''t write it by now (245s)-hopefully most of us know that chat GPT (247s)-and frankly all of the AI chat should be (250s)-taken with a grain of salt they have (251s)-incorrect results just like a Google (253s)-search might have incorrect results you (255s)-might search for a recipe for an old (257s)-fashioned and maybe the 6th or the (259s)-seventh row isn''t actually an (261s)-old-fashioned maybe it''s a different (262s)-variation of it or it''s just it''s either (264s)-a mistake or it''s just a ranking that (266s)-isn''t exactly your query and we''re used (268s)-to that with search but we''re not used (270s)-to it with AI yet so for those of us (272s)-using it the first thing you should do (273s)-is take all AI generated content with a (275s)-grain of salt the second thing and it''s (277s)-something that AI providers are starting (279s)-to do is to provide references for their (281s)-data and that''s something that happens (283s)-so well in the Googles of today is when (286s)-you search for it and you see a snippet (288s)-or you see a summary of a web page you (291s)-see the URL right there and that''s the (293s)-reference built in right if it''s coming (294s)-from CNN or the BBC you can assume it''s (297s)-a reputable news source if it''s coming (299s)-from news dash of Dash the dash day dot (303s)-Biz you''re probably going to want to (304s)-take that with a grain of salt so that''s (306s)-a signal right it''s a reference and the (307s)-more that AI can Surface what they''re (310s)-referencing as they create this content (312s)-the better off all of us will be so I (314s)-certainly wish the best to the open cage (315s)-team I know they''ve been struggling with (317s)-people being angry higher support load (319s)-negative reviews and there''s really no (322s)-way to get around this who do you report (323s)-this to it''s not like you can tell (325s)-openai to regenerate their whole Corpus (327s)-because they have a mistake in one of (329s)-their results so I definitely wish them (331s)-the best as they tried to clean up this (333s)-mess recover from it and move on we''ll (335s)-link up the Tweet the blog post and The (338s)-Hacker News Post in the description of (340s)-this video If you enjoyed

chat Bots for (12s)-documents PDFs (15s)-uh you''ve probably wondered how do I (18s)-also create a chatbot for your website (22s)-or it could be a client''s website or a (24s)-company''s website (25s)-and this is just a basic architecture (29s)-it''s not going to go deep into calling (31s)-because that''s a very Advanced topic (35s)-but at a basic level oh we''re doing (38s)-effectively is (40s)-we scrape around different pages from (44s)-your website (46s)-we convert that to Raw text so this (49s)-great pages will become (52s)-raw text (53s)-so raw text in a is a obviously easier (57s)-for us to work with (59s)-then we split the raw text into chunks (62s)-we covered something similar in the (64s)-previous video (65s)-so you can go watch that about uh (68s)-effectively (71s)-uh create chat Bots out of your notion (73s)-documents so we split this into chunks (76s)-then we embed again check previous (79s)-videos but embedding is converting (82s)-text into numbers or vector numbers (85s)-basically decimal points (88s)-uh in uh thousands of Dimensions so (93s)-it''s the whole purpose is to help make (95s)-it easier for computers to understand (97s)-and work with words and be able to match (100s)-them (101s)-and find uh similar words (106s)-so these embedded (108s)-texts are then stored in the vector (111s)-store (113s)-it''s just a database or storage for (116s)-these numbers that now represent the (120s)-words from your website (122s)-now (124s)-here''s where it gets interesting (126s)-so when a user asks a question let''s say (129s)-they ask a question (131s)-how do I become more productive (136s)-we don''t just want to throw that forward (139s)-to (141s)-you know Skip that whole this whole (143s)-process jump here (145s)-where we spoke about in the last video (147s)-where effectively this question will (150s)-draw out relevant documents from the (153s)-vector store we''ll combine that question (155s)-with the relevant documents as contacts (158s)-is sent to the model (160s)-here we want to actually (163s)-take into account the chat history (166s)-because if you''ve noticed with chat gbt (169s)-you can you can ask it a question (172s)-and then have a chain of interactions (175s)-and it still remembers what you said (178s)-previously so we want to capture the (183s)-chat history (185s)-as we go along as the user goes along to (188s)-ask more questions I hope that makes (190s)-sense I''ll explain more in the code so (192s)-we get that question (194s)-we combined it with the chat history (197s)-then we ask gpt3 can you please create a (201s)-standalone question from the history and (203s)-the question (205s)-we use that Standalone question to (207s)-extract documents (209s)-relevant documents from the vector store (211s)-again (213s)-if you are not familiar from previous (216s)-videos this gets converted into an (220s)-embedding just like here so now you have (224s)-numbers (225s)-matched against numbers we find the most (229s)-relevant number of pairs (231s)-then we can uh (234s)-draw the text from your website (237s)-associated with those similar number (239s)-pairs right so we get those relevant (242s)-documents (244s)-we provide his Contacts Plus the (246s)-Standalone question in the prompt so (249s)-that''s the instruction (250s)-we send it to llam which gpt3 or (254s)-whatever you''re using and we get the (256s)-answer so the answer could be something (259s)-like one of the most effective ways to (261s)-be productive is to create time blocks (263s)-during the day Focus work and then you (265s)-can also give the bot the ability to (268s)-provide references so you can learn more (270s)-in this guide at mywebsite.com guide (274s)-what''s pretty cool about this is (278s)-unlike (279s)-a situation where it''s just one-off (281s)-conversation you can now the user can (284s)-ask a question about this and (288s)-effectively get a response back and (290s)-create a chat but uh activity with your (294s)-website (295s)-so how are we going to do this in this (297s)-demo we''re going to be working with (301s)-this website so Thomas Frank is (305s)-uh someone I''ve followed for a while (307s)-he''s um he''s a productivity expert well (310s)-most (311s)-uh mostly Focus now on notion (314s)-and his tutorials are really really good (318s)-um but the some of them are also really (320s)-really long the uh one of his most (322s)-recent tutorials (324s)-uh was two hours about using the API for (329s)-notion (331s)-so you can see all these guides here (334s)-and I just thought you know what it''ll (336s)-be pretty cool since I''m both interested (339s)-in what he has to say and also very (341s)-interested in notion (343s)-to create a chatbot (345s)-based on his website (348s)-specifically his notion guides and I (351s)-think (352s)-I''ve been able to (356s)-effectively create a chapel out of (359s)-almost 50 000 words something crazy like (363s)-that I''m gonna walk through that with (364s)-you but effectively what''s the what''s (367s)-the first step when you see a website (369s)-you have many options you can call the (372s)-website you know go (374s)-recursively through what''s known as a (377s)-breadth first (379s)-algorithm to get the (382s)-the URLs of every page (385s)-that''s a bit Advanced you can (388s)-figure out what URLs you want to work (391s)-with ahead of time that''s kind of what (393s)-I''ve done because the website (395s)-has (399s)-not too many URLs to work with (403s)-and so I just manually pulled out the (405s)-ones I wanted to use (407s)-yeah this is the crash course I was (409s)-saying I think this is even this is (411s)-about 15 000 words the video is two and (414s)-a half hours (415s)-so not to say that we should have (418s)-watched the video but I think it''d be (420s)-pretty cool to (422s)-be able to ask questions about what''s in (426s)-this website (427s)-and so once you have (430s)-an idea of how you want to work with the (433s)-website (434s)-you just want to hear your developer (436s)-tools so that''s control shift J (439s)-on Windows (441s)-I think I''m not sure why it is or Mac (443s)-and (445s)-you just want to have an idea of the (447s)-structure of the website (449s)-so this is just basic CSS HTML (453s)-but what you''re basically looking for is (455s)-consistency across pages so what do I (458s)-mean so right there if you see where I (460s)-hovered it''s a H1 with an entry so it''s (463s)-a H1 tag (465s)-and it has a class of Entry title (468s)-and that is consistent with all the (470s)-pages (473s)-and if you go further down (475s)-you can see the content (478s)-is all within (481s)-div called entry content (485s)-and so right there already already have (489s)-two reference points to work with (492s)-when it comes time to crawling the (495s)-website to extract the information (498s)-so you just want to analyze (502s)-the key elements of the page you want to (505s)-extract (506s)-and once you have that down (509s)-so you know okay I''ve got the title I''ve (512s)-got the the body of the text (517s)-and then you also want to make sure that (519s)-it''s not a JavaScript loaded page (524s)-because if it is you can still use (528s)-something like Puppeteer this is for the (531s)-JavaScript typescript devs (534s)-um (535s)-but I just generally find it much easier (537s)-to work with websites that most of the (541s)-data is loaded uh straight away it''s (544s)-it''s more static by Nature (547s)-so that way you can use something like (550s)-Cheerio which is a package I''m going to (553s)-show you in a second and what it does (555s)-effectively (557s)-passes through the HTML of your (562s)-uh of the webs of uh positive HTML that (566s)-you provide after you make a get request (569s)-to a page (571s)-so cool so yeah this is pretty (573s)-straightforward you know so you it (575s)-depends what else you want to extract (577s)-and then once you''ve kind of decided (580s)-what you want to get out of (583s)-the document (585s)-um (586s)-of of the pages rather (590s)-so now it''s time to Let''s jump into code (593s)-so I''ll just show you how it works and (596s)-this is a super bass line change so (599s)-we''re going to be using Super Bass as a (601s)-vector store I if you know where a (604s)-certain base is a very uh easy to use (607s)-postgres database it''s open source and (612s)-land changes recently (615s)-uh made uh had created an integration (619s)-with Super Bass so this is the first (621s)-video on it so hopefully you find it (623s)-useful (625s)-so what you need to do here is run this (628s)-script scrape embed (631s)-so it''s just an npm run scrape embed (635s)-now before you do that let me just run (638s)-through (639s)-first of all you need your Super Bass (642s)-URL your Super Bass a non-key and (645s)-service roll key (648s)-so let''s jump into should we jump into (651s)-suitcase actually let''s just carry on (652s)-for a second I''m going to come back to (654s)-that let me just give you an overview (656s)-once you get those keys (659s)-you just want to run the script scrape (662s)-embed (663s)-scrape embed is going to (669s)-take you here so what it does is (672s)-you provide in this case I provided (677s)-these uh guides or these guides the (681s)-thousands of words (683s)-you provide those guides into (686s)-you can change it to whatever you want (688s)-to use (689s)-but the URLs effectively (692s)-go in here so extract data from urls (696s)-you can see the function runs (699s)-with the urls (701s)-and then for each URL extracts data from (704s)-the URL so we have a custom web loader I (707s)-made (708s)-that uses Cheerios as I said cherry or (711s)-pauses (712s)-and Cheerio first we fetch make get (715s)-requested URL get the HTML (718s)-and then return it to (721s)-uh Chariot to load so Chariot passes (725s)-through (725s)-we extract the data that we''re looking (727s)-for again it depends on you you clean it (730s)-up (731s)-then we create a new document so this is (734s)-from Lang chain and this is the format (736s)-that you want to get anything you''re (739s)-loading from into so a document is (742s)-effectively page content (745s)-which is a string and metadata which is (748s)-effectively an object that consists of (753s)-string and any pairs right so it can be (758s)-any string and string property and value (763s)-can be anything (766s)-so that''s how that works in a nutshell (771s)-and so once you run that script (774s)-you should see (777s)-right here so we say the Json file it''s (780s)-going to show up here and then you (784s)-should see (786s)-the next section where we embed the (789s)-document (790s)-we pass in the Super Bass client (792s)-which was (795s)-created in the (799s)-utils folder (802s)-we pass in the docs which is in the (804s)-format of the document as I said and (807s)-then you open the eye embedding so you (809s)-can imagine what''s going on in under the (811s)-hood (812s)-is what I showed in the diagram right (816s)-because (818s)-basically now we have the raw dots and (822s)-so we''re gonna (823s)-go through this process of splitting (825s)-into chunks and then embedding (830s)-so we split the docks into trunks (833s)-and then we embed (835s)-and then when we embed (837s)-we combine the dogs the relevant dogs (840s)-and the prompt and the question we sent (843s)-to you l m but that''s a separate section (846s)-this is just the embedding of the docs ", "start":

show you how (870s)-a vector DBA chain dbqa chain which is (874s)-basically (876s)-um just going into the vector base (878s)-getting similar documents combinary (880s)-question and get a responses a very (882s)-simplified version of what we just (884s)-looked at (885s)-and so it''s just good to test this out (888s)-so I''m just going to (891s)-run (899s)-you can create a script for this I know (901s)-this is tedious (903s)-but I just want to show you (905s)-so now we want to (909s)-ask this question how do I create a oh (912s)- database (915s)-save that (917s)-press enter (925s)-whoops (927s)-uh (931s)-I think I did it wrong (934s)-oh yeah (936s)-cool (938s)-it''s actually Scripts (941s)-demo (947s)-should see your response in a second (964s)-just close this down (973s)-there we go so this is the response you (976s)-can create a notion database by (977s)-duplicating a free template blah blah (979s)-blah you can also add so I just want to (982s)-show you (983s)-you know you can run this script (985s)-yourself but it''s just showing you in a (988s)-nutshell that all is good all is working (991s)-and now (993s)-it''s just a matter of putting the pieces (995s)-together so (997s)-with that in mind this again (999s)-the GitHub repo is going to be available (1001s)-and the image is all so don''t worry you (1005s)-can you can always come back and get (1007s)-this but what are we trying to get to (1009s)-this is the end goal (1011s)-of this (1012s)-uh (1014s)-tutorial so (1016s)-this is pretty much what we''re working (1019s)-towards so if I just jump in here (1023s)-so again this is a website I built (1025s)-around all the guides from this website (1028s)-from Thomas Frank''s website (1031s)-and so (1034s)-here is his face I tell him what you''d (1037s)-like to learn about an ocean so again (1039s)-ask the same question how do I (1041s)-create a notion database (1045s)-press enter (1047s)-we should see a response (1052s)-once you''ve chosen you can duplicate (1056s)-cool (1057s)-now this is the moment of truth (1060s)-is the link gonna work (1063s)-is it gonna work (1065s)-oh no it didn''t let''s see this one (1069s)-oh that one worked awesome (1072s)-so that''s good at least we got one to (1075s)-work but that''s the general gist so if I (1078s)-say something like (1080s)-um (1082s)-how do I automate (1086s)-right in ocean (1089s)-uh how do I ultimately (1092s)-repetitive test (1096s)-lotion (1098s)-let''s see what happens (1100s)-what are you going to say now Tom (1102s)-what''s she gonna say (1106s)-interesting (1110s)-notion automation YouTube data cool (1114s)-uh let''s see now let me try and ask an (1116s)-irrelevant question so let''s say (1120s)-um (1121s)-What is love (1127s)-I wonder what it''s going to say back (1130s)-exactly and so it was pretty cool is now (1134s)-I can say if the user doesn''t understand (1137s)-a response I could say uh what do you (1141s)-mean by (1146s)-um (1148s)-uh let''s see says automation buildup by (1152s)-and (1153s)-automation Builder (1158s)-Builder let''s see what''s going to happen (1167s)-that''s awesome man (1170s)-that is cool (1172s)-and this is the massive guide that he (1174s)-wrote as well that is super cool (1178s)-yeah this is this worked better than I (1180s)-thought so (1182s)-that''s just a demo real quick (1185s)-now let''s jump into Super Bass because I (1189s)-think that''s the only thing I haven''t (1190s)-explained in previous tutorials (1193s)-so (1194s)-first of all what happened (1196s)-when the embedding was done (1199s)-in previous tutorials we did on pycon (1203s)-now we''re using something called PG (1205s)-Vector right it''s an extension on Super (1208s)-Bass (1209s)-and let me just go through the setup (1211s)-real quick (1213s)-so you take this schema (1216s)-here (1218s)-this enables the extension the vector (1220s)-this is your table this is a function a (1224s)-remote procedure called function that (1226s)-runs (1227s)-from your (1230s)-server (1231s)-and what it does is it does the (1234s)-compassion check (1236s)-the aspect of the diagram where We (1239s)-compare the queries Vector to (1241s)-be (1243s)-vectors in the vector vector base to (1246s)-find the ones that are similar so this (1248s)-sign here is a (1250s)-cosine similarity sign (1253s)-and then index for speeding things up so (1256s)-you can copy all of that (1258s)-and then you hop back into Super Bass (1262s)-go on the escrow editor (1264s)-now I''m assuming you''ve already set up (1266s)-your database it''s not too hard to do (1269s)-that (1270s)-and then in here you paste it in and you (1273s)-run (1275s)-once you run go back to table editor (1277s)-you''ll see documents (1279s)-when you click on documents (1282s)-you will see an it will be empty right (1285s)-this is the setup in the beginning (1288s)-you can also go up here and do what''s (1290s)-known as row level security (1293s)-what that does effectively is protects (1295s)-your database for people (1298s)-doing things like inserts and things or (1300s)-updating things without your permission (1302s)-so here I set one that enables read (1305s)-access for all users (1307s)-that''s the only thing they''re allowed to (1308s)-do so they cannot insert they cannot (1311s)-update (1313s)-if we jump back into database (1315s)-you can see that''s going to functions (1319s)-you can see the match document function (1323s)-and then we can see the extensions of (1326s)-the vector extension this is the PG (1328s)-Vector the effective knee and does the (1331s)-storage of embeddings (1334s)-um (1335s)-and also does the similarity checks so (1338s)-that''s pretty cool (1340s)-and then down here you can go get your (1342s)-API keys (1345s)-your URL and your non URL I''m not going (1349s)-to click that because you''re going to (1350s)-see what mine looks like (1352s)-but I think you get the gist (1355s)-in general this is what the embeddings (1359s)-will look like (1360s)-if you''ve wondered (1362s)-so here we have the content (1365s)-right because we split the embeddings (1366s)-remember into chunks so this is a chunk (1371s)-this is metadata that I collected for (1373s)-each chunk (1374s)-so I have a reference to (1377s)-where the data came from (1381s)-and then we have the vectors themselves (1385s)-this is (1386s)-this is what is compared to and there''s (1389s)-I think (1391s)-1536 vectors for openai (1394s)-and that''s it basically in a nutshell so (1396s)-you can see this (1398s)-there''s tons of pages of (1401s)-of his guides (1404s)-and I think that''s basically the Super (1406s)-Bass setup (1408s)-I''m gonna post uh put a link to this (1412s)-guide by Greg very useful it just gives (1415s)-an overview of PG vector and how it (1417s)-works (1419s)-explains embeddings better than I I can (1423s)-you can see it''s just similarities of of (1426s)-numbers (1428s)-um and it just gives an overview of (1430s)-Super Bass and how Super Bass works so I (1434s)-think if you''re not familiar with Super (1435s)-Bass definitely check this article out (1438s)-and have a feel for it (1441s)-cool (1442s)-so (1444s)-in a nutshell (1446s)-we basically (1448s)-have taken if I just hop back in a (1451s)-second (1454s)-here (1457s)-so nutshell (1459s)-we (1461s)-all right hold on a sec let me show you (1463s)-the chat history real quick (1466s)-so that makes sense to you (1469s)-so this is the index (1473s)-you can see we have a message state (1476s)-so the message State consists of the (1479s)-array of messages (1481s)-pending (1483s)-which is pending messages to come and (1486s)-history (1487s)-and so (1489s)-if you see we''re continuously building a (1493s)-stack of messages and history (1496s)-which we''re also using use memo to (1500s)-cachet (1501s)-and if you see when we do make the query (1505s)-to the server we pass the question and (1508s)-the history (1510s)-then the server (1512s)-catches that (1516s)-sanitizes that (1518s)-and effectively uses the question and (1522s)-the history (1523s)-to make a call to the language the llm (1526s)-or the open UI right (1529s)-so I hope that makes sense (1531s)-why we''re kind of capturing these two (1535s)-because otherwise there will be no (1537s)-interaction (1538s)-back and forth between the user and the (1541s)-chatbot (1542s)-so that was the chat and History Section (1547s)-the chat questions section then the (1550s)-Standalone question also inside the (1553s)-chain.com that you just saw (1555s)-and this is the draw where Super Bass (1558s)-will pull out the relevant docs for the (1562s)-vector base using PG vector (1564s)-pastor llm we get a response and that''s (1567s)-it (1568s)-so now we have (1571s)-a simple chatbot for your website (1575s)-very simple so let me just ask Tom one (1577s)-more question (1579s)-and the question will be (1582s)-let''s just hop in the website and see (1584s)-what we can ask him (1587s)-okay (1591s)-let''s say what are some peaceful (1595s)-formulas (1599s)-let''s see what happens (1609s)-nice (1612s)-um (1614s)-how do I (1617s)-use (1620s)-let''s go to (1629s)-how do I (1634s)-create (1636s)-page in motion (1649s)-nice nice (1651s)-this is not bad (1654s)-hey tell me if you''re watching this (1656s)-hit me up but anyway (1659s)-um yeah this this is yeah this is fun to (1662s)-make and I I hope you found it useful (1663s)-and you got a good overview in terms of (1666s)-just (1667s)-making a chatbot for a website obviously (1669s)-on a bigger scale you''re gonna have to (1672s)-crawl the website get all the URLs and (1674s)-do some q a and all of that but this is (1676s)-a very very basic example using Lang (1679s)-chain on how to (1682s)-create a chatbot for your website (1686s)-if you have any questions or feedback or (1689s)-ideas for future videos just hit me up (1691s)-cheers ", "start": 849, "speaker": "SPEAKER_1",

(62s)-have the power to control Our Lives for (66s)-example uh the the (69s)-this (70s)-um for example my mother when uh two to (72s)-three years back told me to wear a ring (75s)-which had a gemstones I still had it on (77s)-have it on because (78s)-of course because that''s what mama said (81s)-so you need to take it over the way the (83s)-boys will think (93s)-a good luck you keep it in

(120s)-live that''s why they look so sure and (122s)-certain and they''re peaceful (125s)-once their stomach is full they''re all (127s)-peaceful do you see this hello (131s)-are you on talking terms with me or no (133s)-one (137s)-do you see all the animals once their (140s)-stomach is full (141s)-they are peaceful (143s)-but human beings are thinking are they (145s)-being taught (147s)-that peace is the ultimate goal of life (152s)-a buffalo full stomach who sits (155s)-peacefully and for you that is the (157s)-ultimate goal what a shame (160s)-yeah (161s)-what a buffalo can do with the stomach (165s)-full of grass or whatever else he eats (167s)-you have to hold it as the ultimate goal (170s)-is it not a shame I''m asking (174s)-but (177s)-this is being thought like this piece is (179s)-the ultimate goal of your life (182s)-but (183s)-coming to more fundamentals if you are (186s)-not peaceful today can you enjoy your (188s)-dinner today (190s)-hmm no can you just enjoy walking down (194s)-the street (195s)-can you enjoy the company of a few (197s)-people around you no if not ecstatic at (201s)-least you must be peaceful (203s)-to enjoy anything in your life so I am (205s)-asking should it be the first step in (207s)-your life or the last step in your life (209s)-such people will only rest in peace (215s)-now do other things have influence on us (218s)-particularly inanimate objects (223s)-the gems and the Diamonds (226s)-and things like that and also the (228s)-planets (231s)-see the nature of the planet has a (235s)-certain influence on the life upon it (239s)-you will see on Full Moon days and New (241s)-Moon days many animals behave in certain (244s)-specific ways simply because they are (246s)-influenced by it you know the whole (248s)-ocean is rising (251s)-when ocean which is millions and (254s)-millions of tons of water is able to (257s)-rise (259s)-when 72 percent of your body is water (262s)-you think it won''t rise at all (265s)-it does (269s)-so (271s)-I don''t know if you''re conscious of it (273s)-but in India most people are not only in (276s)-India in anywhere wherever there are (277s)-mental asylums and things they are (279s)-conscious of It On full moon days and (281s)-New Moon days people get exaggerated (284s)-levels of disturbance in their minds (287s)-so people think new moon and full moon (289s)-will cause Madness no that''s not the (291s)-truth (292s)-if you''re very loving (295s)-full moon day you will become more (296s)-loving (297s)-if you''re very joyful on a full moon day (300s)-you will become more joyful if you''re a (302s)-little crazy you''ll get a little more (304s)-crazy whatever is your quality gets (307s)-little hyped on that day (310s)-so those who are romantic they want full (313s)-moon day (314s)-those who want to meditate they want (316s)-full moon day those who are little mad (318s)-they don''t want full moon day (322s)-essentially it''s hyping things up a (325s)-little bit (325s)-of course today there is another kind of (328s)-textbook science which is going on which (330s)-doesn''t observe anything except what (332s)-happens in the laboratory (335s)-these people are going on saying this is (337s)-all rubbish this is that (339s)-no if you pay attention to your own body (341s)-you will know without looking up without (343s)-looking at the calendar you will know (345s)-when is full Monday when is New Monday (347s)-by yourself simply if you pay sufficient (350s)-attention to your own system because (352s)-it''s visible in your system certain (354s)-behavior is there but with a human being (357s)-the problem is or (360s)-people seeing it a problem (362s)-any pro any possibility if you do not (366s)-explore that possibility in your eyes it (369s)-looks like a problem (371s)-what is a problem is always a (373s)-possibility isn''t it (376s)-you don''t like it (381s)-what is the possibility (383s)-if you do not explore it if you do not (385s)-realize what is the possibility it seems (388s)-like a problem to you (390s)-so do inanimate things have impact on (394s)-you yes if you will love it because this (397s)-is the human predicament that who you (400s)-are is not determined by Nature it is (402s)-left open for you (403s)-left open for you means you are the only (406s)-creature on this planet who has been (408s)-given the freedom to shape your own life (411s)-is it a small thing this is a product of (416s)-millions of years of evolution that (418s)-today after all these creatures from a (421s)-single-celled animal to after this (423s)-millions of forms here we are sitting (425s)-this is the only creature which can (428s)-shape its own life the way it wants (431s)-every other creature has to live by the (434s)-laws of nature we can shape our own (437s)-lives (438s)-it is this Freedom that human beings are (441s)-suffering if you''re suffering your (442s)-bondage it''s all right if you''re (445s)-suffering your freedom freedom you''re a (447s)-disaster isn''t it (454s)-you''re suffering your bondages you''re (456s)-chained to something you''re suffering (457s)-that understandable (459s)-but you are suffering because you are (462s)-free most human beings are suffering (465s)-because they are free they are always (467s)-trying to bind themselves to something (469s)-or somebody all the time because Freedom (472s)-scares them (474s)-because freedom is a padless path (478s)-Freedom Is An Open terrain there''s no (481s)-fixed line because there is no fixed (485s)-pathway most people feel terrified (490s)-but (491s)-the highest value in human life is (493s)-freedom isn''t it so (495s)-hello (497s)-in this culture (499s)-the highest value in this culture is not (501s)-God not heaven mukti Moksha Liberation (506s)-freedom is the highest value (509s)-established that no matter what you do (513s)-you must seek mukti you can do whatever (515s)-you do with your life but all that (518s)-process should be towards your (519s)-Liberation you must be moving towards (521s)-higher and higher levels of freedom on a (523s)-daily basis otherwise your life is not

(544s)-you still keeping Bombay right I see (549s)-before you joined IIT (551s)-when you have written your ad you know (553s)-whatever entrance tests and stuff (556s)-only thing is somehow I want to get in I (558s)-want to get in because it it''s like (560s)-heaven entering heaven (562s)-no matter what I want to get in that''s (564s)-the only thing I want after you get in (566s)-see how many problems (573s)- (576s)-I am asking you a simple question (579s)-being on this planet (582s)-do you have any proof (584s)-that you are not already in heaven and (586s)-making a mess out of it (591s)-do you have any proof (594s)-suppose you took off from the solar (596s)-system and looked down at the solar (598s)-system whatever these 12 14 planets and (601s)-satellites and works (603s)-does planet Earth definitely look like a (605s)-Heavenly Body among all these (607s)-yes or no so you are already on heaven (611s)-and making a mess out of it and now you (613s)-want to go to another heaven (618s)-this culture does not value heaven (621s)-does not value God (623s)-values only Freedom we want to be even (626s)-free from the creation and the Creator (629s)-mukti Moksha is the ultimate value (632s)-because (634s)-this is not a philosophical value this (637s)-is not a religious value this is (639s)-something every life is longing for only (641s)-thing is most human beings are (644s)-short-sighted that they long for it in (646s)-installments (649s)-see whatever people are seeking right (651s)-now (652s)-if they have nothing they will say if I (655s)-get 100 rupees per day Shiva that''s all (657s)-I want that''s a prayer (659s)-100 rupees fell (661s)-100 rupees fine fine three days hundred (664s)-rupees fine fourth day only 100 rupees (666s)-Shiva what''s the problem with you are (669s)-you so stingy at least a thousand rupees (671s)-a day (673s)-okay thousand rupee notes is it in legal (675s)-tender thousand rupino (684s)-foreign (698s)-wonderful Shiva fantastic (700s)-after 10 days oh only two thousand (703s)-rupees (705s)-it doesn''t matter how much it falls (708s)-something more something more something (710s)-more isn''t it this is not about money (713s)-people think it''s about money people (715s)-think it''s about wealth power pleasure (718s)-love knowledge no these are all (720s)-different currencies (722s)-essentially you''re looking for expansion (725s)-because you feel suffocated (728s)-if we keep you in the same place for too (730s)-long you feel suffocated you want (731s)-expansion you want to be something more (734s)-all the time (735s)-yes or no (737s)-always something more will you settle (740s)-with fulfillment (741s)-no you will look at other planets you (743s)-look at the new galaxies (745s)-so there is something within a human (747s)-being which wants to expand limitlessly (751s)-that means it wants to be free nothing (753s)-else looking at this carefully observing (757s)-the nature of the life within that it (759s)-wants to expand in a limitless way the (762s)-only thing it is longing for is to (763s)-become boundless (765s)-that means it''s seeking Freedom that is (767s)-why in this culture we established the (770s)-highest value is mukti or Moksha which (773s)-means liberation of Freedom not heaven (776s)-not because heaven is just another place (779s)-maybe little better

(65s)-possible (66s)-there are people it is a very beautiful (69s)-instance which happened (71s)-in 1930s (76s)-you have heard people going into long (78s)-chantings maybe in the temple or (81s)-somewhere have you heard people doing (82s)-hormones and all chanting and chanting (84s)-away for hours together (87s)-so this chanting was used to wire the (90s)-brain in a very big way because the (92s)-sounds that you employ has a big impact (95s)-on what happens in the brain (97s)-so these mantras were structured as (100s)-certain mathematics is involved in this (103s)-and a certain poetry is also involved in (105s)-it at the same time (107s)-because of using a certain level of (110s)-structured sounds it wired their brains (112s)-so much (114s)-that they have a phenomenal sense of (116s)-memory which is almost humanly (119s)-impossible (120s)-normally in modern times we consider (123s)-these things humanly impossible they had (125s)-that kind of memory because of using (127s)-these sounds in a particular way (130s)-this happened (132s)-to people went to Banaras friends (138s)-they were having a bath in the river and (141s)-among themselves they were talking (143s)-and they were making a business deal (146s)-so it was agreed that one friend offered (151s)-50 000 Rupees to the other friend to do (154s)-business (156s)-so right there verbally orally they made (158s)-a agreement (160s)-and it was done (163s)-and after a few years (165s)-because there was no written paper when (168s)-this man wanted the money back the other (170s)-man said you never gave it to me (172s)-no such thing happened (174s)-so he went to the court when he went to (177s)-the court he had no proof he said I have (179s)-given the money but he had no proof (181s)-then the judge said you have to get some (184s)-proof otherwise (186s)-we cannot do anything about it then he (189s)-remembered when they were in the river (193s)-they saw (195s)-Abraham and priest who was having birth (197s)-close to them so he just hoped that (201s)-maybe he would have heard what we spoke (203s)-and I can bring him as a witness (206s)-so he went looking for that man in (208s)-Banaras he found the man (211s)-and to his disappointment he realized (213s)-that the man did not know English these (215s)-people were talking in English language (216s)-and this priest did not know English (219s)-language (220s)-so he thought this is no good (223s)-then the Brahman asked why (225s)-then he told him see four years ago we (228s)-were having bath and you were also there (230s)-I was just hoping that I could use you (233s)-as a witness (235s)-the Brahman said okay I can repeat (237s)-whatever you said whatever you two had (239s)-conversation I can repeat that (241s)-he does not know

language but he (257s)-could repeat every word what they said (259s)-and he was brought to the court and he (261s)-won the case (264s)-so our memory and our ability to do (267s)-things can be so greatly enhanced if (270s)-only we handle this inner situation (272s)-right and one simple thing to do (276s)-if all of you are willing we can bring (278s)-many more steps into it but one simple (281s)-thing to start with is learning to be (283s)-just still (284s)-if you sit somewhere (286s)-simply learning to just sit absolutely (289s)-still (290s)-and moving just sitting still you will (294s)-see your ability to grasp and your (296s)-ability to use the brain will be greatly (298s)-enhanced (300s)-so I want you to understand this (304s)-everything that you see (306s)-hear smell taste and touch (310s)-is recorded (312s)-your memory problems are only your (314s)-ability to (316s)-bring it back when you need (318s)-there''s no recording problem (320s)-it is recording everything (323s)-but you are not able to pick out what (325s)-you want if you want to pick this out (326s)-something else is coming (329s)-so that is just a question of clarity (331s)-not of memory (334s)-memory means suppose if we say this (337s)-phone has low memory what does it mean (340s)-it has limited capability to record (342s)-isn''t it (345s)-if I press 2 if fire comes (348s)-what does it mean bad memory (351s)-or bad keyboard (354s)-bad keyboard so this is a question of (357s)-bad keyboard (358s)-is not a question of bad memory (360s)-it''s very important that you''ll you call (364s)-2-2 not far (368s)-it is a question of bad keyboard don''t (371s)-try to fix the memory memory is great (374s)-everything that you see is recorded (376s)-you''re not able to type out the right (379s)-number (380s)-that''s all the problem is isn''t it (383s)-so this is not a question of memory this (386s)-is a question of clarity (388s)-so we have to work on Clarity what is it (391s)-that gives us Clarity of mind (395s)-first thing is we learn to if if our (399s)-Clarity is not not good by itself (402s)-the simple thing is (404s)-handle things with a certain (407s)-precision (414s)- (426s)-where your feet should be prepared (429s)-not here like this where your hand (432s)-should be like this (435s)-it''s not proper (437s)- (441s)-inserting all this my head is looking (443s)-down oh not like this (446s)-like this (448s)-precision (450s)-now you come down when you sit down (453s)-you watch this okay how your pants (456s)-should be like this (460s)-whatever you brought with you your book (462s)-where your notebook should sit where you (465s)-spend suits it they should sit just (467s)-practice this (468s)-with every little thing just bring the (471s)-Precision into your activity it will (474s)-happen in your mind (476s)-you will see then if I say this it goes (480s)-to number two it won''t go to five (485s)-yes (487s)-now gets confused so handle it slowly (490s)-two three one (494s)-okay two is here 3 is here one is here (498s)-you just do this with every aspect of (500s)-your life (501s)-you go to bed how it should be (504s)-everything (506s)-you go in your room how it should be (509s)-just bring this meticulousness of what (512s)-you''re doing with the Asana into your (513s)-life you will see slowly mind will (517s)-become very very clear it becomes (519s)-meticulous with everything (521s)-the simple practice that you have to do (523s)-from this moment when you stand up when (526s)-you sit down when you walk and when you (529s)-go out here (530s)-you just look like this like you''re (532s)-doing what (535s)-chandrasana like this (537s)-how many columns in this (540s)-don''t try to count all of them the first (542s)-row if you simply look like this oh it''s (546s)-five columns (549s)-just you must register this five columns (553s)-one vessel (555s)-one sitting Rock one big rock one Pond (559s)-another three another four columns one (562s)-door how tall looks like twelve feet (566s)-just do this (568s)-with everything how many steps from here (571s)-to there don''t count like one two like (574s)-this (576s)-oh after you take three steps okay (579s)-that''s I think three (580s)-another three another three another (582s)-three (583s)-after a few days count eleven (587s)-or fourth or five (590s)-just like that without thinking you must (592s)-slowly know that okay I think I work 12 (596s)-steps (598s)-this is yoga (601s)-the this effect will happen over a (603s)-period of time by itself but now we are (606s)-in a hurry (607s)-so use the mind also (610s)-to do it to bring the Precision what (612s)-you''re trying to bring in your body (614s)-bring that Precision in your mind also (616s)-let the Mind imitate the body (619s)-you will see Clarity will naturally come (622s)-memory is not the problem everything is (624s)-anywhere recorded (629s)-I will abuse you right now (632s)-I''m going to abuse you badly (634s)-try to forget it (639s)-will you for all your life you''ll (641s)-remember it (643s)-yes or no so you got great memory you (646s)-just remember bad words that''s all (654s)- (657s)-if you exercise your mind like this (661s)-it''ll become in such a way (663s)-that you can make it do what you want (666s)-you will see slowly mind will become (669s)-very very clear (671s)- (673s)-when your mind is single pointed it''s a (675s)-powerful instrument (678s)-this is something that you do within (680s)-yourself (681s)-so that you''re able to slip behind the (684s)-mind (686s)-if we know who

store their tofu outside in (123s)-the winter and they would bring it back (125s)-in and then they would defrost and then (127s)-it would become a text really a totally (128s)-different thing it becomes a sponge it (130s)-can soak up all of the lovely flavors (132s)-that you''re cooking that tofu with on (133s)-top of that from a pan searing (135s)-perspective we''ve used the freezing (137s)-method to take out as much liquid and as (139s)-much moisture as possible so you can get (141s)-that crisp exterior that you''re looking (142s)-for the best way to feed your tofu is in (144s)-some sort of sealed environment either (145s)-on a metal tray like this with plastic (147s)-wrap over the top or a container with a (149s)-lid you want to drain that water out (151s)-first and (152s)-just throw it inside of the freezer (155s)-that''s the best way to do it the second (156s)-best way and the lazy man''s way to do it (158s)-is to just throw this entire package (160s)-sealed into the freezer and then take it (163s)-out a little bit later from my tests (165s)-it''s much better to freeze the entire (166s)-block of tofu than to cut it up first (168s)-and then freeze it afterwards (170s)-interestingly in order to get this as (172s)-dry as possible you want as much (174s)-moisture as possible in the tofu as (176s)-you''re freezing it because you''re going (177s)-to remove it later so this is the frozen (178s)-tofu that''s what it looks like after (180s)-letting it sit on the tray this is your (183s)-final this is your product this is what (185s)-that frozen (186s)-pre-frozen tofu looks like the same (188s)-brand of tofu too right yeah same block (190s)-of tofu side by side firm tofu (193s)-you can see (195s)-that this one is significantly smaller (196s)-because it''s already naturally purged a (198s)-lot of that liquid but we''re going to (199s)-squish the rest of it out i''m going to (200s)-cut it in half so you can see what the (202s)-inside actually looks like (204s)-all of those holes (206s)-totally because (208s)-ice shards just loosen it up (210s)-make sense now because it''s in the (212s)-freezer it''ll last forever if you know (214s)-that sometime in your future you''re (215s)-going to do this just throw blocks of (217s)-tofu in the freezer and keep it there (218s)-just take it out before you want to cook (220s)-it once you''ve taken out of the freezer (223s)-you want to press it you want to expel (225s)-that extra liquid you can also do (227s)-between your hands it''s sponge don''t (229s)-worry about pressing it

SPEAKER_1: (0s)-it is March 16 2023 and you''re watching (3s)-the code report but well hello my fellow (4s)-printers yesterday mid-journey released (6s)-its version 5 model in Alpha and the AI (9s)-images it can produce are shockingly (10s)-realistic like the guy with the shocked (12s)-face that got you to click on this video (14s)-is 100 artificial as a programmer and (17s)-content creator who recently lost his (18s)-job to AI I''ve been looking for a new (20s)-line of work my initial thought was to (22s)-get into modeling because my mom says (24s)-I''m extremely good looking unfortunately (25s)-I found out that models are now obsolete (27s)-it''s now possible to generate them in (29s)-all shapes and sizes and you''ll never (31s)-know the difference unless you look (32s)-really closely at the fingers there are (33s)-many different companies and projects (35s)-competing to be the best generative (36s)-image model in 2023 stable diffusion is (39s)-the leading open source project then you (41s)-have tons of closed Source projects like (42s)-Dolly from open Ai and countless others (45s)-trying to monetize the space but in my (47s)-opinion mid-journey is the most (48s)-impressive place to prove the images (50s)-just pop they''re vibrant realistic and (52s)-aesthetically pleasing for that we (53s)-shouldn''t be thanking mid-journey but (55s)-all the photographers and artists Who (56s)-unwillingly provided the data set to (58s)-create this black magic that will make (59s)-the their sons and daughters obsolete (61s)-interestingly the U.S copyright office (63s)-just recently ruled that generative AI (66s)-art cannot be copyrighted because you (67s)-need to show proof of human authorship (69s)-if you take some AI art and modify it as (71s)-a human then it could become eligible (73s)-but it''s reviewed on a case-by-case (74s)-basis that''s good news because it means (76s)-grifters can''t just prove something out (78s)-and license it to you as a copyrighted (80s)-work the ones who will make the most (81s)-Bank in this movement are the ones who (83s)-provide the models like mid-journey and (85s)-open AI open AI started as a non-profit (87s)-but then transitioned to for-profit when (89s)-they realized how much mother F and (91s)-money they were going to make on this (92s)-thing in any case I''m happy to pay 10 (93s)-bucks a month for co-pilot 20 bucks a (95s)-month for chat GPT and 10 bucks a month (97s)-for mid-journing together they put (98s)-almost all of human creativity at your (100s)-fingertips making you a demigod in the (102s)-digital world at the same time it will (103s)-likely ruin creativity because who wants (105s)-to create art when you know some (106s)-company''s just going to steal it and (108s)-remix it into an infinite number of (110s)-variations to the point where nobody can (111s)-tell the difference it takes the (112s)-incentive away from True human Talent (114s)-Feast your eyes on this toad had you (116s)-told me Alex Gray painted it I''d believe (118s)-you but he didn''t I''m guessing his (119s)-artwork is in the mid-journey data set (121s)-but this is my artwork I proved it at (123s)-fair and square and here''s how you can (125s)-do it too mid journey is handled (126s)-entirely in Discord there''s currently no (128s)-API but I imagine that''s coming someday (130s)-once in the Discord all you have to do (132s)-is go into one of the Newbie channels or (134s)-your direct messages and type in the (135s)-Imagine slash command from there just (137s)-describe whatever image you have in your (139s)-imagination and let it go to work (141s)-congratulations you can now put prompt (143s)-engineer on your resume it''ll create (144s)-four different variations of your idea (146s)-then you can choose one of them to make (148s)-even more variations or you can choose (150s)-to up sample them individually currently (152s)-version 5 is an alpha and if you want to (153s)-use it use the V flag at the end of your (156s)-prompt to get highly realistic images of (158s)-humans I would also recommend adding the (159s)-Q flag as 2 to increase the quality (162s)-there''s all kinds of different (162s)-parameters you can use to change the (164s)-output some of the most useful ones (166s)-include aspect ratio do change the shape (168s)-of the image and chaos to control the (170s)-amount of craziness the higher the chaos (172s)-the more random stuff you might get in (174s)-the output image what''s especially (175s)-awesome though is that you can also (176s)-provide a starter image which can just (178s)-be a hyperlink to any image URL on the (181s)-internet that means if you have a long (182s)-lost relative you can bring them back to (184s)-life in new artwork and photos it''s not (186s)-going to be deep fake accurate but it''s (187s)-still pretty creepy all of this (189s)-generative AI stuff might seem (190s)-terrifying if you''re a digital Creator (192s)-however there is one glimmer of hope (193s)-it''s very possible that you were made (195s)-with AI and if you can''t tell the (197s)-difference then what does it matter this (199s)-has been the code report thanks for (200s)-watching and I will see you in the next (202s)-one

In this chapter, we learn about several unique ideas surrounding AI-generated images. Mid-journey released a version 5 model that can produce shockingly realistic AI images, rendering models obsolete. The U.S copyright office rules that generative AI art cannot be copyrighted because proof of human authorship is required. Using the V flag and Q flag as 2 can produce highly realistic images of humans with improved quality. Mid-journey''s platform is entirely handled on Discord with no API currently available. On the other hand, we learn key lessons about AI-generated images. The credit for these images should go to the photographers and artists who provided the data set, not the AI companies. AI-generated images could ruin creativity and hamper true human talent. However, anyone can create AI-generated images using mid-journey, and prompt engineering can be put on a resume. If AI-generated images cannot be distinguished from human-made ones, then it doesn''t matter if they were made with AI.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '19a1e545-58df-4d2f-a0be-7e30748c1eee');

SPEAKER_1: (0s)-a little on the 72 hours ago a language (2s)-model was released that could end up (5s)-being as consequential as gpt4 now I (9s)-know you were thinking that''s a bowl (10s)-claim but let''s see if you agree with it (13s)-after watching what happened I will (14s)-explain as best as I can what was (16s)-released and how revelations in the last (19s)-24 hours from Apple Amazon Britain and (23s)-Baidu make it particularly significant (26s)-the model was Stanford''s alpaca and here (29s)-is the key line alpaca behaves (32s)-qualitatively similarly to open ai''s (35s)-text DaVinci 3 while being surprisingly (39s)-small and easy and cheap to reproduce at (43s)-under 600 now that is cool but how does (47s)-that change the world well first it (49s)-wasn''t supposed to get this cheap this (52s)-fast just six weeks ago or five weeks (55s)-before they released the model Arc (57s)-Investment Management put out this (59s)-prediction that the 2020 cost of GPT 3 (63s)-at 4.6 million dollars would take until (66s)-2030 to fall to something as (69s)-insignificant as 30 dollars if Stanford (72s)-have done what they claim then 99 of (75s)-this cost reduction has happened within (77s)-five weeks of this prediction being (80s)-published not eight years as AI (83s)-researcher Elie Isa yudkowski puts it I (86s)-don''t think people realize what a big (88s)-deal it is that Stanford retrained a (90s)-llama model by cheaply fine-tuning it (93s)-now I''m going to explain all of this in (94s)-a moment it then goes on I''m not sure I (96s)-can convey how much this is a brand new (99s)-idiom of AI as a technology now Stanford (102s)-claimed their model performs comparably (104s)-to DaVinci 3 which is GPT 3.5 of course (108s)-I''m going to test and analyze this in a (110s)-moment but how could it be that a 600 (112s)-model can compete with chat gbt well do (116s)-you remember how meta open sourced their (118s)-llama models about two weeks ago (120s)-Stanford used the weakest of these open (123s)-source models these seven billion (125s)-parameter one and then essentially they (127s)-recruited GPT 3.5 to train that meta (132s)-model how could they possibly do this (134s)-well they used self-instruct and I dug (137s)-into the literature to find the original (139s)-paper on self-instruct this was released (142s)-in December of last year and I''m going (144s)-to give you the 30 second summary of how (146s)-it works essentially you start off with (148s)-some human-made examples of Exemplar (151s)-prompts and outputs these are fed into (154s)-the language model and then you ask it (156s)-to generate thousands more such (158s)-instances you filter out the bad ones (160s)-and then put all the good examples back (163s)-into the language model then it (164s)-understands the instructions much better (166s)-and produces thousands more examples as (168s)-the paper says this is Almost Human (171s)-annotation free and remember this stat (173s)-it only leaves a five percent Gap behind (176s)-instruct GPT what is instruct gbt well (180s)-it''s the Breakthrough that led to chat (182s)-GPT in the first place look at the (185s)-original gpt3 if you gave a prompt like (187s)-explain the moon landing to a (189s)-six-year-old in a few sentences you''ve (190s)-got this gobbledygook here after months (193s)-of onerous human training called (195s)-reinforcement learning with human (196s)-feedback he was able to follow (198s)-instructions much better and produce an (201s)-outcome like this but this relied on so (204s)-much human labeling and human ranking of (206s)-outputs from best to worst Stanford and (209s)-the self-instruct breakthroughs showed (210s)-that you could cut all of those costs so (212s)-in summary they used an open source meta (215s)-model and got GPT 3.5 to train it one (219s)-Advanced model teaching another as (221s)-yudkowski points out these models have (223s)-enough pseudo-intelligence that they can (225s)-stare at other models and imitate them (228s)-indeed openai may have even predicted (230s)-that this was possible in their terms of (232s)-service it says you may not use output (235s)-from the services like Chachi BT to (238s)-develop models that compete with openai (240s)-so they knew it was possible and even (242s)-Stanford admit that this breakthrough (244s)-enables more people including Bad actors (246s)-to create new cheap models yutkowski (250s)-also points out that one of the reasons (251s)-reasons why chat GPT and gpd4 are so (254s)-good is that they rest on proprietary (256s)-data and that that was supposed to give (258s)-them a competitive moat which is now (261s)-revealed people can quite cheaply steal (263s)-just before I test and demonstrate our (266s)-packer in action let me summarize how it (268s)-works using the self-instruct process (270s)-you get GPT 3.5 similar to chat gbt to (274s)-create thousands and thousands in this (276s)-case 52 000 instruction following (279s)-examples automatically filtered by (281s)-quality Stanford then used an open (284s)-source model indeed the weakest of the (286s)-Llama models and trained it using those (289s)-examples the end result alpaca so let''s (292s)-see in action and compare it to Chachi (294s)-PT and gbt4 oh and just quickly you know (297s)-that training of the Llama model with (299s)-those 52 000 examples it only took three (301s)-hours and cost less than a hundred (303s)-dollars the first example I''m going to (305s)-show you does not come from me I found (307s)-it in this academic paper Linked In the (309s)-description and it''s a task which (311s)-requires understanding detailed and (314s)-dissonant scenarios applying appropriate (316s)-legal precedence and choosing the (318s)-correct explanation the correct answer (320s)-if you want to read through it or not is (322s)-B alpaca gets this question right or I (325s)-should say it gets it right about 80 of (327s)-the time you can keep clicking generate (328s)-and sometimes you do get the answer D (330s)-but about 80 of the time four times in (333s)-five you get the correct answer B how (335s)-about chatty BT well every time I''ve (337s)-tried it it''s gotten the wrong answer of (339s)-c and gpt4 shocking even to me it also (343s)-gets it wrong and picks C now before you (345s)-get too excited I am not saying that it (348s)-is better than or even as good as gbc4 (351s)-or chat GPT it''s not but remember it''s (354s)-only 7 billion parameters and 600 worth (357s)-take this example I asked it for an (360s)-example of an animal that begins with (361s)-the same letter as the capital city of (363s)-France and it said elephant no idea (365s)-where it got that now In fairness (367s)-chapter BT gave me lion and gbc4 gave me (371s)-ferret but there are other questions (373s)-where alpaca definitely flops for (375s)-example this math question which Chach (377s)-BT and gbt4 uniformly get right alpaca (381s)-simply gets it wrong every time I tried (384s)-asking it in lots of different ways with (385s)-Chain of Thought prompting but no every (388s)-time it gets it wrong it''s definitely (390s)-not better than those models but by the (392s)-end of the video you''ll see why it''s (393s)-revolutionary anyway at this point if (395s)-you''re learning anything please don''t (397s)-forget to leave a like or a comment to (399s)-let me know basic addition and (400s)-subtraction it does better and yes it (403s)-can crank out poems solve some hella (405s)-swag Common Sense problems and generate (408s)-literary analogies but at this point I (410s)-want to remind you of three things first (413s)-that it was using the weakest of the (415s)-Llama open source models they could have (418s)-used these 65 billion parameter model (420s)-for a bit more cost I''m sure the results (422s)-would have been even more impressive (424s)-next you remember it was trained by (426s)-examples generated using the DaVinci 3 (429s)-Model well that cost them about 0 0.03 (432s)-dollars per 1000 tokens but as 48 hours (436s)-ago they could have used the gpt4 API at (440s)-a very similar cost so it wasn''t the (443s)-best open source model and it wasn''t (444s)-trained by the best GPT model I am (447s)-genuinely curious as to what the results (449s)-would have been if it had been trained (451s)-by the 65 billion parameter model using (453s)-a gpt4 API maybe someone''s going to do (456s)-that maybe even this week but just (458s)-before we get on to Apple Amazon Britain (460s)-and Baidu I just want to restate this (462s)-was all done for 600 or less they even (466s)-say there were training efficiencies (468s)-they could have done for example using (469s)-the h100 gpus that would have further (471s)-reduced the cost the question is if it''s (473s)-so easy and cheap to imitate a larger (476s)-model what''s going to happen when Apple (478s)-released their large language model it (480s)-was only revealed yesterday in the New (482s)-York Times that they are indeed working (484s)-on one and don''t forget they have far (486s)-more money than the other companies (488s)-mentioned Amazon recently stated that (490s)-they have been working on similar Tech (492s)-to chat gbt for a long time and looking (496s)-in the literature as early as mid last (498s)-year they had a model called Alexa TM (501s)-that outperformed gpt3 and as you may (504s)-already know but I do demonstrated their (507s)-Ernie bot today although they didn''t (509s)-allow anyone else to use it apparently (511s)-it''s better in the Chinese language than (513s)-even gpt4 but because they didn''t (515s)-release a paper and we can''t check it we (517s)-simply don''t know and of course we can''t (519s)-forget Google who just two days ago (521s)-announced the Palm API what would have (524s)-happened if Stanford''s model had used (526s)-that one I''m sure we will soon find out (529s)-but to take us back to the start I have (531s)-one overriding observation and two (533s)-questions first these models weren''t (536s)-supposed to get this cheap this fast (538s)-that is going to upend the economics of (541s)-large language models my questions are (543s)-these does this mean that all incentive (546s)-is gone for Microsoft or Google to pour (549s)-in billions of dollars producing these (551s)-Cutting Edge models if anyone can just (553s)-easily reproduce them will they react by (556s)-making the models even more closed and (558s)-disallowing gpt5 from having an API we (561s)-don''t know but as even Nation States (563s)-enter this quote-unquote arms race (566s)-spending hundreds of millions of pounds (568s)-in this case to build great GPT are (571s)-these companies and governments drifting (574s)-into a war on two fronts where they (576s)-compete with each other but also with (578s)-Outsiders who are trying to cheaply (581s)-imitate their models if you''ve learned (583s)-anything in this video please do leave a (585s)-like and leave a comment but either way (587s)-have a wonderful day

Berkshire go down top tick (14s)-to bottom tick by 50% I think it''s in (18s)-the nature of long-term shareholding (22s)-with the normal vicissitudes and and (25s)-worldly outcomes and in markets that the (30s)-long-term holder has his quoted value of (33s)-a stock go down and then by say 50% fact (39s)-you can argue that if you''re not willing (40s)-to react with equanimity to a market (45s)-price decline of fifty percent two or (49s)-three times a century you''re not fit to (52s)-be a common shareholder and you deserve (54s)-the mediocre result you''re going to get (58s)-compared to the people who do have the (60s)-temperament who can be more (64s)-philosophical about these market (66s)-fluctuations (70s)-you can never take all the boom-and-bust (72s)-out of a capitalist economy but they (75s)-could be enormous li dampened if there (78s)-were wise legislative restraints on (80s)-human conduct that eliminated more of (83s)-the Semin folly that will inevitably (85s)-come without the wiser strains and what (90s)-happened in America is that the people (92s)-who were making money out of a lack of (94s)-wiser strengths just got more and more (98s)-power by doing more and more lobbying (100s)-and making larger and larger political (103s)-contributions and I''m being aided by a (108s)-certain ideological nuttiness which (113s)-assumed that because free markets worked (116s)-so well compared to say communism it (119s)-automatically followed that if there (121s)-were no laws at all restraining (123s)-financial conduct the economy would work (127s)-better and that''s not so the economy (131s)-works worse if you allow unrestrained (136s)-Semaan fellahin in finance that goes (140s)-back all the way to the South Seas (142s)-bubble without a system of wise (144s)-restraints gross immorality and extreme (150s)-craziness will happen in markets they (155s)-need to be dampened sin and folly needs (159s)-to be stepped on (162s)-both parties have wings that are full of (167s)-idiots that is the nature of the game (171s)-and the reason it''s worked as well as it (174s)-has is that the people in the middle of (177s)-sort of over time tuned out the idiots (180s)-on both side and but every once in a (183s)-while (184s)-the idiots get in control and of course (189s)-that has terrible consequences so you (191s)-realize the nature of the system you''re (193s)-thinking of the loss and Terry went way (196s)-too far in financial deregulation week (201s)-and people were making so much money and (209s)-the economy was doing so well because it (213s)-was

only one who promptly said I (268s)-was a horse''s ass I''m ashamed of my lack (272s)-of foresight I missed this (274s)-who else but Alan Greenspan is talking (277s)-that way so and in my book he''s sort of (282s)-a hero in that it is hard at his age to (287s)-look back at a KERS distinguished as his (290s)-with as much success and adulation and (294s)-basically say I was a horse''s patoot and (297s)-that''s what he''s done so to me he''s a (301s)-hero we need more of that sort of thing (307s)-Wall Street tracks and rewards but I (312s)-call a locker room culture tell other (315s)-people

(344s)-room culture that has to win and doesn''t (349s)-is not very squeamish about what they (356s)-have to do to win (362s)-we have to deal on things that were (364s)-capable of understanding and then once (369s)-we''re over that filter we have to have a (373s)-business with some intrinsic (376s)-characteristics that give it a durable (378s)-competitive advantage and then of course (380s)-we would vastly prefer a management in (384s)-place with a lot of integrity and talent (386s)-and finally no matter how wonderful it (391s)-is it''s not worth an infinite price so (394s)-we have to have a price that makes sense (397s)-and gives a margin of safety considering (402s)-the natural vicissitudes of life that''s (404s)-a very simple set of ideas and the (408s)-reason that our ideas have not spread (410s)-faster is they''re too simple the (413s)-professional classes can''t justify their (418s)-existence if that''s all I have to say (420s)-it''s all so obvious and so simple what (424s)-would they have to do with the rest of (425s)-the semester (430s)-well at the time we bought it it was (437s)-succeeding mightily on multiple fronts (441s)-and it was cheap in relation to what was (447s)-plainly going to happen that was a (451s)-valuable insight there are times when (455s)-even a company as big as coca-cola is to (457s)-cheaply priced by the market considering (460s)-what it''s going to do for the (461s)-shareholder and there are times when we (464s)-can figure that out and there are times (466s)-when we can''t and the times when we can (469s)-figure it out we tend to go in heavily (472s)-for many many months we were buying as (476s)-much coca-cola as we could buy roughly a (480s)-third of the volume trading every day (483s)-for months so we were very aggressive in (488s)-buying into coca-cola (492s)-we have the mindset of the person that''s (495s)-buying the whole business at the price (500s)-you would realize by multiplying the (502s)-price we''re paying by share by the (504s)-number of outstanding shares and and we (508s)-want the price for the whole business so (512s)-calculated to look very attractive so we (517s)-like buying individual shares at a price (519s)-that''s lower than we think a rational (522s)-person would pay if he could buy the (523s)-whole business (529s)-born would have been a huge success of (531s)-charlie munger never lived how often do (534s)-you speak to him well in the early days (537s)-it was almost every day and now it''s (540s)-maybe once a week only once a week yeah (543s)-not very much but sometimes it''s a long (546s)-conversation you and Warren are very (551s)-much a double act in the chairman and (554s)-vice-chairman of the company at some (555s)-point you want to probably retire and (558s)-shoot step down rest a bit well I don''t (562s)-think either of us wants to quit except (565s)-as the laws of physiology force it and (570s)-that no doubt will be soon on us but you (578s)-got to remember that Berkshire is (581s)-probably the most decentralized big (585s)-corporation in the world (586s)-I think the very decentralization of (589s)-Berkshire and the extreme pockets of (592s)-talent in all the subsidiaries will give (595s)-Berkshire a very respectable future long (598s)-after we''re gone and you''ve got to (602s)-remember that we started a little (605s)-nothing and our successors are starting (611s)-with something that is not a little (613s)-nothing and you ought to be able to (618s)-achieve a lot more when you''re given a (623s)-mighty hand then you were when you start (627s)-with a little nothing they won''t be able (629s)-to multiply money as fast per share (632s)-because that can''t happen when you''re (634s)-working with such large sums but in (637s)-terms of a creditable institution that (640s)-serves the wider world (642s)-I think Berkshires contribution after (650s)-Warren is dead will utterly dwarfed the (654s)-contribution made while he was alive

In this chapter, Warren Buffett shares unique ideas and key lessons about long-term shareholding, wise legislative restraints, advocating for common shareholder reaction, dealing with locker room culture on Wall Street, criteria for buying individual shares, and the decentralization and extreme pockets of talent in all subsidiaries.
Buffett emphasizes the importance of understanding and accepting normal market fluctuations in long-term shareholding. He also emphasizes the need for wise legislative restraints to eliminate financial conduct misconduct, such as Seman folly. Advocating for common shareholder reaction, he stresses the importance of reacting calmly to market price declines. Dealing with locker room culture on Wall Street is also a key lesson he shares, pointing out the enormous damage it causes to the rest of us. For buying individual shares, he emphasizes the criteria of intrinsic characteristics that give durable competitive advantage and buying at a price that makes sense with a margin of safety, i.e., buying at a price lower than what a rational person would pay if they could buy the whole business. Finally, he notes the extreme pockets of talent in all subsidiaries and the decentralization that give Berkshire Hathaway a respectable future long after the current leaders are gone.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '19a1e545-58df-4d2f-a0be-7e30748c1eee');

they did so i wasn''t lost in a great metropolis   (14s)-and i was very fortunate in my nature of my 
parents my parents friends and i was fortunate   (23s)-in the public schools i attended were pretty 
remarkable by the standards of the time and (32s)-of course most of my schooling was in the great 
depression but that means i''m one of the very few   (39s)-people that''s still alive who deeply remembers 
the great depression and that that''s been very   (45s)-helpful to me it was so extreme that people like 
you have just no idea what the hell it was like   (52s)-and it was really there was just nobody had 
any money the rich people didn''t have any money   (58s)-people would come and beg for a meal at the 
door and we had a hobo jungle not very far   (64s)-from my grandfather''s house and i was forbidden 
to walk through it which meant i walked through   (70s)-it all the time and i was safer in that hobo 
jungle in the depths of the 30s when people were   (76s)-starving practically that i am walking around 
my own neighborhood now in los angeles at night   (82s)-the world has changed on that you''d 
think the crime would be less but   (88s)-it was the crime was pretty low in those days 
so anyway so i had a very unusual bunch of   (95s)-experience to be to go through civilization in 
various phases including the greatest recession   (103s)-well i say it''s one of the greatest recessions 
in 600 years in the english-speaking world   (109s)-it was really something and it 
was very interesting to watch   (114s)-and and also to watch it fixed it was fixed 
by the accidental keynesianism of world war ii (124s)-very interesting and hitler had fixed the great 
depression in in germany by the deliberate   (133s)-keynesianism but he wasn''t doing it to 
stimulate the economy he wanted to get even   (138s)-with all the people he hated but he borrowed all 
this money and created all these armaments and (148s)-hitler''s germany by 1939 was the strongest 
economic power in europe and nobody else was close   (155s)-so and you wouldn''t understand that as well as i 
do if you hadn''t lived through it you just didn''t   (161s)-see the place gaining traction more and more 
and more and more and pretty soon it was fixed   (168s)-and and and of course that was in those days 
there were all kinds of people most of my   (176s)-family they believed in hard money based on gold 
and not much welfare and so on and so on so that   (182s)-i was raised among fairly backward people by 
modern standards but they were backward in kind   (187s)-of a self-reliant way that i think was helpful 
i''ve never regretted that i wasn''t raised in a   (195s)-more liberal establishment i had a liberal aunt 
she was really my mother''s cousin but she i was   (202s)-and she was the first second lady dean at the 
university of chicago and she done her thesis   (208s)-on the conditions in the coal mines and of 
course she was a screaming leftist i would   (213s)-be a streaming leftist if i observed the way 
the coal miners of yesteryear were treated   (218s)-you couldn''t be a human being with any decency in 
you without feeling it was deeply improper to have   (226s)-the misery that great and have it manipulated 
for the benefit of the mind owners and so forth   (232s)-but she sent me all these left wing 
bangs books one every christmas   (237s)-and i always thought she was a little nuts (243s)-which shows that if sometimes a very vivid 
extreme ex you know evidence misleads you   (250s)-on the deeper reality you''ve got to be a 
guard on that against that all your life   (256s)-in fact the whole trick in life is to get 
so that your own brain doesn''t mislead you   (261s)-and and i have found that just a lifelong fun 
game and i can''t remember a time i wasn''t doing it   (271s)-i was not a prodigy or anything like that but i 
was i was a prodigy in having adult interests i   (280s)-was interested in what worked and what didn''t and 
why and i could see that very imminent people that   (286s)-i loved and revered were nuts in some ways and i 
would decide well i certainly like dr davis but   (293s)-he''s a little nutty in one way and i''m not going 
to be that like that and so it was very judgmental   (299s)-and i think that helped me and also helped 
me that i kept changing my judgments as   (306s)-i learned more and more facts came in and 
that created lifelong habits that were very   (313s)-very useful another thing i think really helped me 
is particularly on my father''s side of the family (322s)-my paternal grandfather was the only federal judge 
in lincoln nebraska the capital city of nebraska   (329s)-and he''d been there forever and he stayed 
there forever after that i think when he   (334s)-left he was the longest-serving federal judge 
in the country and he was a brilliant man and   (341s)-he''d risen from nothing he was the child of 
two impoverished school teachers and when he   (349s)-was raised in the little town of nebraska they''d 
give him a nickel to go buy the meat and he''d go   (356s)-to the butcher shop and he would buy the 
parts of the animal nobody else would eat   (361s)-and that''s what two schoolteachers lived on in 
those days and the very indignity of it bothered   (367s)-him so much that he he he just determined to get 
out of poverty and and never go back and he did   (376s)-he got ahead like abe lincoln educated himself in 
lawyer''s offices and so on he had to leave college   (383s)-because he couldn''t pay the tuition anymore 
and but he educated himself and since he was   (389s)-utterly brilliant it wasn''t all that hard and 
he had an attitude it was pretty damned extreme   (398s)-and i would say his attitude was that you have a 
moral duty to make yourself as unignorant and as   (406s)-unstupid as you possibly can and that it was your 
pretty much your highest moral duty maybe taking   (412s)-care of your family came first but but in the 
ranks of moral obligations quasi-related well   (419s)-he was conventionally religious so it may have 
been a religious duty to him but he he really   (424s)-believed that that rationality was a moral duty 
and he worked at it and he scorned people who''d   (433s)-who didn''t do it on the other hand as a judge 
he started with the idea that why would anybody   (440s)-rob a train or whatever federal crime in those 
days and he was pretty hard on people who did   (446s)-it and i noticed as he got to older and older and 
older he was willing to call a man a good man on   (452s)-easier terms than he started out with and i think 
that was a correct a correct development in my   (461s)-by the way when he relaxed a 
little he was still pretty tough   (466s)-but he he did relax a little 
which i thought was appropriate   (470s)-and but it was influenced by such people 
and when the 30s came one son-in-law (480s)-was a musician and of course he couldn''t make a 
living so my grandfather didn''t have that much   (485s)-money sent him to pharmacy school carefully 
picking a profession that couldn''t fail and   (490s)-found him a bankrupt pharmacy to buy and loan 
him the money and my uncle was soon prosperous   (496s)-and remain prosperous the rest of his life my 
other uncle had a bank in stromsburg nebraska   (503s)-but there were 968 people in stroudsburg 
and there were two national banks   (508s)-and the capitalization of my uncle''s bank 
was 25 000 and of course he was a lovely man   (517s)-but he was an optimist and a 
banker should not be an optimist   (523s)-and when they closed the banks in 1933 the 
banking examiners came in and they said   (529s)-you can''t reopen and it was the only business he 
had well judge monger had always saved his money   (536s)-and he had a lot of good first mortgages on homes 
occupied by t-totaling german butchers and people   (544s)-he''d carefully pitched and of course he never had 
a default houses were in the right neighborhood   (549s)-the people were sober and hardworking and so what 
my grandfather did is take a third of his good   (557s)-mortgages which is all he had put him into the 
bank and took all the lousy assets out of the bank   (563s)-so he saved two out of three of his 
of his children and i thought it was a   (571s)-pretty good thing to do and very sure the 
way he did it and he actually got most of   (577s)-his money back 10 or 15 years later out of 
the lossy assets of the bank when world war   (583s)-ii and that was a good lesson on the other 
side my grandfather on the other side his   (591s)-main business had gone broke in 1922 with all the 
other wholesale dry goods houses and what he did   (601s)-his son-in-law one of them went broke and he 
cut his house in half and moved that family   (605s)-in and the other family the guy was an honors 
graduate of the harvard school of architecture   (611s)-and he was very prosperous in the 20s in omaha 
and had a wonderful life and the 30s came the   (618s)-total building permits in omaha would sometimes be 
25 000 a month and that was for furnace repairs or   (624s)-something there was just no work none zero so he 
moved to california and he lived for several years   (632s)-and he got finally he got the county of los 
angeles to hire this great harvard architect   (637s)-and his he got 108.08 a month after deductions and (645s)-they had him do drafting work but they 
classified him as a laundromat to save money   (651s)-and he could actually rent a house for 
25 and feed himself and drive an old car   (655s)-but he could live on 109 a month amazing how 
poor everybody was and what happened to that   (663s)-grandfather is along came the fha and they had a 
competitive civil service examination and he was   (668s)-a very brilliant man of course he was first in 
the exam and that made him the chief architect   (671s)-for the fha in los angeles where he spent the 
rest of his life but i watched all this family   (678s)-coping with all this difficulty and i''ll say this 
it sounds awful but they weren''t all that unhappy   (686s)-you can cope pretty well because you get used to 
it that''s a nice thing about the human condition   (693s)-and when you get to be my age you''ve got 
a lot of horrible things to get used to   (699s)-it''s just one new indignity all the 
time a friend of mine says a good day   (705s)-when you''re old is when you wake up 
in the morning and nothing new hurts   (712s)-so anyway that''s my experience in omaha but that 
background of these all these people were educated   (718s)-and civilized and generous and decent and a lot of 
them had good senses of humor and it was a pretty   (727s)-damn good place to grow up in and my memory is of 
being surrounded by a lot of very fine people and   (738s)-i i think the whole thing was privileged i look 
at my background is absolutely privileged i''m   (744s)-proud of being an omaha boy i sometimes use the 
old saying they got the boy out of omaha but   (750s)-they never got them all out of the boy and and so 
all those old-fashioned values family comes first   (760s)-be in a position so you can help others when 
troubles come prudent sensible moral duty to   (767s)-be reasonable more important than anything else 
more important than being rich more important than   (772s)-being important an absolute moral duty 
because none of my intelligent relatives   (780s)-suffered terribly because they didn''t advance 
higher right yeah i mean one of the things i''m   (785s)-fascinated by is um i mean this was in the 20s 
and 30s and the level of detail that you recall   (790s)-about their experiences and how that''s shaping 
your experiences now i''m trying to give people a   (795s)-flavor of something that nobody else can remember 
yeah i mean you''re you''re you''re a student of   (801s)-the people that you''re that you''re experiencing 
so so you grow up in omaha nebraska um you find   (807s)-yourself in ann arbor michigan how does that 
happen very simple i wanted to go to stanford (817s)-and my father said to me charlie i was the only 
son two two sisters he says i''ve got two daughters   (824s)-to educate right after you i don''t have unlimited 
money he says i will send you this stanford if   (830s)-it really means a great deal to you but i''d 
rather you pick a university in the midwest   (836s)-much better than mine which was the university 
of nebraska and that was obviously going to be   (840s)-michigan what was i going to say well screw you 
and send me to stanford oh i didn''t say that   (846s)-i went to michigan so you come to michigan 
i have never regretted that at all i loved (858s)-at stanford people came to stanford in the 30s 
with their string of polo ponies and it was a   (867s)-very upscale fraternity sorority culture i used to 
call it the co-educational princeton of the west   (876s)-and and people loved it and so forth but literally 
you''d go to stanford with a string of polo ponies   (884s)-i should say i''m bringing back to you young people 
a time you can''t remember who did you ever know   (891s)-in college that came with a string of polo phones 
not very many people now they go they''d be in the   (897s)-rotc but they have their own string of polo ponies 
you could win better if you have your own string   (905s)-so you come to michigan and you study math for 
a year yes but i don''t get credited for that   (913s)-when i was young i could get an a in any 
mathematics course without doing any work at all   (919s)-and so i always took math because it meant that 
i could literally i never did any problem sets i   (924s)-just did the math and and so i i should not 
get credit to some budding mathematician i   (932s)-was choosing what for me was the easiest way 
to think about what i wanted to instead of   (938s)-what somebody else wanted me to do well come to 
find out it ended up being a subject that has   (943s)-i think paid some dividends hugely yeah but but 
but this will interest you in this world where   (952s)-people have all these algorithms and computer 
science and fancy math and so forth neither warren   (958s)-or i''ve ever have ever used any fancy math and 
business and needed ben graham who taught warren   (965s)-everything i''ve ever done in business 
could be done with the simplest algebra and   (970s)-geometry and addition multiplication and so forth 
i never used calculus for any practical work in   (978s)-my whole damn life and that was it and i was 
a perfect whiz at it when they taught it to me   (983s)-and by the way since i never touched calculus 
not one after i was 19 years old i''ve lost it (993s)-the symbols would mystify me and but i think 
you''ll find that if you really know the basic   (999s)-stuff it''s enormously useful and only a very 
few people are ever going to need any calculus   (1006s)-so you study math at michigan then the war 
comes calling yeah you move to california   (1011s)-and you study meteorology well that was because 
i was too dumb to do what i should have done   (1017s)-with with my background i should have gone to 
the naval rotc because i hated infantry rotc   (1024s)-which i''d done four years of in high school rising 
to be second lieutenant which is a very low rank (1032s)-and of course i was about five feet two i got 
my growth late and so i was i didn''t it was   (1038s)-not your ideal of a manly soldier in high school 
so when you went to harvard law why why why law   (1047s)-my grandfather and father had been lawyers and i 
knew i didn''t want to do everything else it''s very   (1053s)-simple i didn''t want to be a doctor i didn''t 
want all the blood and misery and so forth   (1058s)-and the repetitive work i knew i didn''t want 
to go to the bottom of a big organization and   (1064s)-crawl my way up i''m a natural contrarian that was 
not going to work for me and i found that people   (1069s)-could tell me when i thought they were idiots and 
that is not a way to rise in a big organization   (1076s)-and so i couldn''t do that and so now i''m left 
with with law i went and i admired my father and   (1085s)-grandfather in a good life for them so i naturally 
drifted into it i think people are still going to   (1091s)-law school for that reason it''s the least bad of 
options considering their interests and ability   (1099s)-i guess now people go to business school some 
of them who in my day would have gone through (1105s)-yeah many of the people in this room i think are 
going to go to business schools the least bad to   (1109s)-their options and all i can say is that that''s 
the way it worked for me and it''ll probably   (1115s)-work out for you and it worked out okay it worked 
out okay so i had to leave the profession well it   (1121s)-was a dumb profession for me so so that''s actually 
what i want to ask so you move to california you   (1126s)-actually start a law firm and then practice law 
for some period of time i had no alternative (1135s)-and then you actually had an army 
of children almost immediately (1141s)-i painted myself in quite a corner yeah so zero 
choice is pretty powerful yeah for sure yes of   (1149s)-course so so you practice law and then you 
leave law in the firm that you helped found   (1156s)-and move over to investments well but help 
us understand that that sounds miraculous (1165s)-in fact it was rather interesting i probably 
got paid about 350 000 in my first 13 years   (1173s)-of law practice total and i had an army of 
children and no capital to start with and when i (1186s)-chose this alternative career i had over 
three hundred thousand dollars in liquid   (1191s)-instruments so i had and that 
was 10 years of living expenses   (1198s)-so i was not a courageous venture some 
admirable man i was a cautious little squirrel (1206s)-saving up more nuts than i really needed 
and not going very deep into my pile of nuts   (1213s)-and so that was it wasn''t that courageous and i 
kept one foot in the law firm while i tried my   (1218s)-capitalist career but as soon as the capitalist 
career succeeded i intended to lift that second   (1224s)-foot because i recognized that the potential 
of law practice as i saw it then i didn''t   (1231s)-anticipate the boom that came to the big firms 
and i just saw it as being more difficult and i   (1238s)-wanted more independence than i was going to have 
as a lawyer i hated sending other people invoices   (1245s)-and needing money from richer people i thought 
it was undignified i wanted my own money   (1253s)-not because i loved ease or social prison i 
wanted the independence well and and when you so   (1262s)-you founded wheeler monger and company so that is 
the investment firm yes and for and i went and i   (1269s)-created five real estate projects i did both side 
by side for a few years and a very few years i had   (1276s)-three or four million dollars and for a number 
of years you outperformed the market 2x 3x   (1284s)-and so why did you then leave willermunger and 
company and then move to now what you''re doing   (1292s)-well i had three or four million dollars which 
was a lot of money then and i also knew how to   (1298s)-handle that three or four million dollars very 
well by that time and so i i knew i didn''t need   (1306s)-to get fees and override some other investors and 
i found that when you got into things like the 70   (1313s)-64 74 75 crunch which is the worst since the 30s (1325s)-i didn''t suffer i knew everything was going to 
work out but the quoted prices of these things   (1330s)-really went down to ridiculous levels and some 
of my investors i knew were suffering you know   (1335s)-i needed the money and of course i have enough 
of a fiduciary gene that that pained me greatly   (1342s)-and so i said well it''s just it''s like the my 
grandfather once asked him how he felt when my   (1349s)-aunt divorced my uncle and he said i feel just 
the way i did when they lanced my carbuncle and   (1354s)-that''s the way uh i had a carbuncle my fiduciary 
chain was giving me pain and i said the hell   (1361s)-would i lance the carbuncle i just lived on my own 
money no fees no overrides no salaries this just   (1370s)-seemed more manly to do when i knew it would work 
and so at what point did you meet warren and 1959 (1382s)-and and so where did berkshire hathaway 
come from in terms of this partnership   (1386s)-that you all have now had for decades well 
warren had been taught by ben graham to buy   (1391s)-things for less than they were worth 
no matter how lousy the business was   (1395s)-you can''t imagine a more lousy business than 
new england textile mills because textile is a   (1403s)-congealed electricity and the electricity rates in 
new england were about 60 percent higher than tba   (1410s)-rates so it was absolute inevitable certain 
liquidation now warren should have known better   (1419s)-than to buy into a totally doomed enterprise 
but it was so damn cheap he could have added a   (1423s)-big discount from liquidating value so he bought a 
big china finally ended up in control of business   (1431s)-but the business was going to die so the only way 
to go forward from there was to bring enough money   (1437s)-out of this declining tectos textile business to 
have more money than he paid to get in and use it   (1443s)-to buy something else that''s a very indirect 
way to proceed and i would not recommend it   (1450s)-to any of you just because we did some dumb 
thing that worked you don''t have to repeat   (1456s)-our path and uh and of course we eventually 
learned not to buy these cigar butts when they   (1465s)-were cheap and do these painful liquidations and 
and and instead buy better businesses that''s the   (1474s)-main secret of berkshire the reason that berkshire 
has been successful was a big conglomerate more   (1481s)-successful than any other big conglomerate so far 
as i know any other big conglomerate in the world   (1491s)-the reason it''s been successful is we try and 
buy things that aren''t going to require much   (1495s)-managerial talent at headquarters everybody 
else thinks they''ve got a lot of managerial   (1501s)-talented headquarters and that''s a lot of 
hubris if the business is lousy enough it   (1508s)-gets a wonderful manager the business has a lousy 
reputation and the manager has a good reputation   (1515s)-it''s the business of the it''s the reputation 
of the business that''s going to remain intact   (1520s)-you can''t fix these really lousy businesses   (1524s)-you can ring the money out whatever comes 
in liquidation and do something else with   (1529s)-it but most lousy businesses can''t be fixed but 
at the time warren was that''s what he was doing   (1536s)-and so yes how did you convince him i 
helped him he bought a windmill company   (1542s)-in a little town in nebraska and warren didn''t 
know anything about running a windmill company   (1549s)-he bought it because it was cheap he said what 
do you do why can''t you fix my windmill company   (1555s)-who can you get to help me i said i''ve got just 
the man for you and so one of my old colleagues   (1561s)-from a transformer business who was an accountant 
i said he will fix your windmill company and   (1567s)-warren was desperate he didn''t he just hired him 
on the spot and harry walked in the first day this   (1575s)-little town this big collection of windmills and 
so forth and a whistle blew and the whole point   (1583s)-stopped for 15 minutes what the hell is this and 
says well it''s respect for the time that everybody   (1589s)-has a funeral he''s blow this whistle and stop for 
15 minutes and harry said that''ll be the last time   (1596s)-and he just approached everything that way and 
of course another thing he did is he he cut   (1602s)-away all the fat that he didn''t need and then he 
found there were certain parts where we were the   (1606s)-sole supply and he raised all the price of those 
parts you can see what a business genius we are (1615s)-so how did you convince warren to stop buying 
the bad apples and start buying the good apples   (1622s)-i think warren warren he gave me credit for that 
he was going to learn it anyway he just made   (1627s)-so much money in this other stuff and he''d been 
taught by ben graham it was hard for him to quit   (1632s)-when he was just coining money but he saw the 
point and well you couldn''t scale that business   (1642s)-and and and it was kind of scrunchy and 
unpleasant and you''re firing people who in   (1649s)-the hell wants to do that so so we just rung 
the money out and bought better businesses   (1656s)-and we''ve been doing it ever since coming to 
business not as business school graduates but as   (1663s)-people who would own portfolios of securities we 
thought like capitalists because we were always in   (1670s)-shareholder mindset a lot of people running 
the businesses think like careerists   (1675s)-and believe me you got to think like a career 
is to some extent if you''re in a career   (1680s)-but also helps to look at the business 
strategy problems as though you''re an owner   (1687s)-and so my advice to you is you don''t want to 
be never get to be a career so much you don''t   (1693s)-see it from the owner''s point of view that''s what 
general motors did they had a bunch of careerists   (1698s)-and an owner would have seen immediately 
the the situation was hopeless   (1702s)-and they just romped through it with a lot of 
denial and stupidity and pomposity and of course   (1709s)-they went bankrupt the mightiest company in the 
world went bankrupt and and none of those hotshot   (1717s)-executives thought like an owner they would 
have seen that it was hopeless so charlie one   (1723s)-of the things i''ve always been fascinated about 
it was hopeless the way they were handling it   (1728s)-well with berkshire in the way that you all manage 
both headquarters and the businesses that you own   (1735s)-you are putting talent in place who think 
like shareholders not careerists so how do you   (1743s)-when you''re buying a business how do you or 
or bringing talent into an existing business   (1747s)-how do you evaluate talent to see are they 
going to think more like a shareholder as   (1751s)-a private equity frequently by a business 
where the founder is going to leave then   (1755s)-they go on our talent to run it that is a 
tough way to make a buck and i don''t like it   (1762s)-we generally buy with the talent in place 
now maybe some guy in the number two place   (1768s)-and we put him in the number one place but 
we very seldom i can hardly i can''t think   (1773s)-of any place where we bought something 
and put somebody in after harry bottle (1780s)-and no we don''t do that and and it''s 
amazing how long we have some of those   (1785s)-people stay born always says we can''t we 
can''t teach the new dogs the old tricks (1796s)-what''s the implication of not being able to (1803s)-teach the old dogs new tricks (1810s)-or new tricks to old dogs when if we look 
at what''s happening in business today   (1817s)-what we see is exactly we can''t teach 
the old tricks to the young dogs that''s   (1821s)-that''s what we found and and 
we keep the old dog in place   (1830s)-but that''s not that''s not the norm right i 
mean if we look around it''s the norm in life   (1834s)-it may not be our practices may not be the 
norm but normally it''s very hard to get the   (1839s)-you got a wise old dog getting a young 
dog that could match him that''s hard   (1845s)-by definition he''s survived a big culling process 
sure i mean he''s he''s he''s unique and he''s got a   (1853s)-record to prove it and by the way everybody 
thinks you can judge people by an interview (1862s)-and of course you know who you like you know you 
don''t like but everybody overestimates how much   (1868s)-you can tell in prediction by meeting somebody we 
all like to think that we have that capacity but   (1875s)-it''s a vastly stupid type of overconfidence the 
paper record has about three times the predictive   (1881s)-value of your impression in an interview and 
of course we''re buying great paper records   (1888s)-it''s so simple but it''s it''s fascinating to me 
if we look around business generally the movement   (1895s)-of people across firms and there''s always new dogs 
and you''ve taken a contrarian position to that and   (1903s)-managed berkshire differently well it doesn''t like 
work of course we''re still hiring young dogs in   (1908s)-the end of these businesses but it''s amazing how 
much of the record of berkshire has come from the   (1916s)-old dogs who are in the business when we buy them 
you can''t believe how good those people have been   (1924s)-there''s one huge exception 
in the new dog department   (1929s)-i almost despise the business of executive 
search because i find that they really want to   (1936s)-sell you the best that''s available even if it''s 
no damn good and i don''t like that but the best   (1945s)-single expense that berkshire ever had as we paid 
an executive recruiting firm to find assaji chain   (1952s)-to come into our little tiny insurance operation 
he''d have any experience in insurance at all   (1959s)-he was an honors graduate of the maine technical 
institute of india he was a very smart man   (1964s)-but he he came in and created our whole reign 
it''s the only big business we created from scratch   (1969s)-and ajit did the whole damn thing of 
course he talked with warren every night   (1973s)-and so it was like father and son remember this is 
a very confusion company and and uh but that was   (1981s)-unbelievable so we we hired an executive recruiter 
he brings us an indian has no experience at all   (1986s)-insurance he talks about old man every night 
and it''s now by far the biggest reinsurance   (1994s)-business in the world and it''s 
been a goldmine there''s at least (2001s)-60 billion dollars in berkshire of net worth that 
ajit has created that we would not have created   (2009s)-without him wow and the value is way more than 
60 billion i mean there''s i mean there''s that   (2014s)-much an extra just liquid net worth but the value 
of the business is way more than 60 billion wow   (2021s)-so charlie i''m going to i''m going to turn 
to a few questions from the audience uh   (2024s)-as we uh as we start to uh to wrap up um 
probably half my questions here are about   (2030s)-bitcoin and cryptocurrency well 
i can answer those very quickly (2040s)-i think it''s perfectly asinine 
to even pause to think about them (2047s)-you know it''s one thing to think that gold has 
some marvelous store of value because man has   (2054s)-no way of inventing more gold or getting it 
very easily so it has the advantage of rarity   (2060s)-believe me man is capable of 
somehow creating more bitcoin (2066s)-they tell you they''re not going to do it but 
they mean they''re not going to do it unless   (2069s)-they want to that''s what they mean when 
they say they''re not going to do it and   (2076s)-if they hear their rules and they 
can''t do it don''t believe them   (2080s)-when there''s enough incentive bad things 
will happen it''s bad people crazy bubble (2089s)-bad idea luring people into the concept 
of easy wealth without much insider work   (2098s)-that''s the last thing on earth you should think 
about if it worked it would be bad for you to try   (2103s)-and do it again it''s totally insane and by the way 
i''ve just laid out a wonderful life lesson for you   (2114s)-give a whole lot of things a wide berth they 
don''t exist you know crooks crazies egomaniacs   (2128s)-people full of resentment people full of self-pity   (2132s)-people who feel like victims there''s a whole 
lot of things that aren''t going to work for you   (2139s)-figure out what they are and then avoid them 
like the plague and one of them is bitcoin   (2145s)-and the worst thing would happen if 
you won because then you do it again   (2149s)-it''s total insanity and it''s so easy to simplify 
life from just all these things are beneath you   (2157s)-now i don''t even want to know people 
are promoting bitcoin i don''t want to   (2161s)-know my address so charlie i''m not my kind 
of people charlie what i hear you saying is   (2168s)-you''re not going to be investing in bitcoin 
is that that''s fair i think you''re fair so   (2174s)-so so let let me move to a a similarly uh 
maybe controversial topic i don''t i you know   (2181s)-i don''t know if you read the news recently 
but there''s a lot of tax policy conversation   (2186s)-uh going on both here in california and nationally 
as well um what what what''s your thought on   (2193s)-where this ends up uh in terms of the tax policy 
i think we will get a tax bill i think they''ll   (2199s)-squeak it through and they''ll make whatever 
adjustments they have to to get the last few boats (2209s)-i don''t think it''s a bit crazy to give this 
extra two thousand a year all those people   (2215s)-will make seventy thousand dollars 
a year and have a lot of children   (2219s)-that strikes me as a it''s good 
politics and probably good policy   (2225s)-i also do not think it is crazy to reduce the 
corporate income tax on the c corporation and   (2234s)-if you look at the world a lot of the places that 
have worked best including singapore and so forth   (2240s)-have that policy and may even have 
good macroeconomic consequences   (2247s)-and a lot of the people who are screaming 
about it and are so sure it won''t work (2255s)-they may not be right it may 
actually work pretty well   (2259s)-it causes the capital values of the companies 
to come up and there''s a wealth effect   (2267s)-from the increased market value of 
all the companies everybody recognizes   (2275s)-there''s an effect but people some people say it''s 
small and some people say it''s going to be large   (2280s)-and i''ll tell you what they all 
have in common none of them know   (2285s)-it is not totally inconceivable 
that it will work pretty well   (2289s)-and with so much of the world doing well 
with similar tax policy and of course (2297s)-the darkest go berserk on this subject and but (2304s)-i think i think they''re wrong it may actually help 
them yeah so i''m i''m i don''t i don''t i''m not sure   (2313s)-it''ll work it may not but it''s not totally crazy 
well it reminds me of a piece of advice that uh   (2321s)-that you''ve uh you''ve offered and given to me 
which is you know people often have a point of   (2328s)-view and the danger in uh in having that point of 
view is you start to assume with certainty that   (2335s)-you''re right absolutely totally crazy and and and 
i think what your point of view is is you need to   (2342s)-have a point of view here''s a very important 
subject i''ve been thinking about all my life   (2348s)-you answer my opinion yes i don''t really know 
how well it''s going to work i don''t think   (2353s)-anybody else does either i think it''ll work 
to some extent but how much i don''t know now   (2361s)-is it unfair well the corporations are by and 
large owned by a bunch of charitable endowments   (2367s)-and buy a bunch of pension plans 
and the whole world is going   (2374s)-into a world where they''re trying to have the   (2378s)-business interests of the company support their 
huge pension obligations get bigger all the time (2386s)-china is trying to do exactly what the 
republicans are china wants to have the   (2392s)-main businesses in china owned more by the 
pension plans and the stocks to do well   (2398s)-i don''t think china''s crazy to have that i 
don''t think the republicans are crazy either   (2403s)-it could work pretty well and and and it''s not 
just some evil thing that people are cooking up   (2413s)-it''s a disagreement between people and 
both sides who have violent hatreds and   (2419s)-contempt for the other side they''re wrong it''s a 
disagreement on policy that ought to be civilized   (2428s)-when i see congress on my television 
set and the degree of hatred they have   (2434s)-utter contempt i mean really 
serious way more than as usual it''s   (2443s)-it''s evil to hate that much it''s a 
mistake to hate that much that much hatred   (2448s)-will turn it''s always been true as anger 
comes in reason leaves it''s a truism   (2455s)-so do you want to adopt a political point 
of view or you''re angry all the time   (2460s)-if you do welcome to the house of misery 
and pretty low worldly achievement to boot   (2466s)-so if that''s what you want i i you just if i found 
out how to do it behave like those people you see   (2471s)-on television well the other thing is both parties 
by the way yeah the other thing that''s true   (2476s)-going back to one of the earlier comments is the 
difference difference between a careerist mindset   (2483s)-and a service or shareholder mindset where 
in politics we have the emergence of a   (2490s)-careerist mindset that is shaping how people 
behave because they''re trying to survive   (2496s)-not only that they have a group think just as the 
moonies go crazy because they hang around together   (2504s)-so do our politicians yeah do you want to 
go crazy is that your ambition in life you   (2510s)-start with some advantage just make yourself a 
violently believing politician on either side   (2517s)-you''ll turn your brain into cabbage you only got 
one brain why would you want to turn into cabbage (2526s)-so charlie i''ve got a question here what''s the new 
amazing technology that you''re most excited about

question i''m not going to ask you to try (2613s)-i''ll tell you the answer i''ll tell you the answer   (2616s)-david ricardo missed he got the first order 
consequences of trade perfectly right and   (2623s)-it was not an obvious insight and it was a great 
achievement which is but he didn''t think about the   (2630s)-second order consequences he wasn''t mathematical 
enough to see and he wasn''t mathematical to think   (2637s)-what would happen when one country had way 
higher living standards than another and   (2643s)-he like adam smith he missed the main issue in 
a place like the united states is if you have   (2652s)-an advanced nation and some other nation which is 
numerous but the people of anything are better on   (2658s)-average than yours in terms of their inequality 
which i think is roughly true of china and and (2669s)-and they''re in poverty they''re living in 
caves and they''re caught in a malthusian trap   (2674s)-and you''ve got an advanced economy 
and you suddenly go into free trade   (2679s)-what is going to happen is ricardo approved 
it both sides are going to live better right   (2684s)-but the people here that are assimilating 
all the great economies of the world in   (2689s)-china they''re going to go way faster 
so you go up two percent a year and   (2692s)-they go up 12. and pretty soon they''re the 
dominant nation in the world and you aren''t   (2697s)-well are you really better off well the answer 
is no and ricardo will never figure out any of   (2702s)-that stuff so i''m telling you that so that you 
can fix your inadequate knowledge of ricardo and   (2710s)-and but one of the interesting problems of 
that is you can''t understand ricardo properly   (2716s)-and thinking about the united states visa be 
free trade with china without thinking about the   (2721s)-tragedy of the commons because if we had the only 
nation in the world except for china we could say   (2729s)-we won''t trade with them we''ll just leave them in 
their damned agricultural poverty and we''ll just   (2733s)-you know and we could probably have done that 
but the whole rest of the world will trade   (2739s)-they''re going to rise anyway so we don''t have 
any power to to to hold back the rise of china   (2749s)-by not trading with them so we had to do what 
we did and once you do that now they''re going   (2754s)-to be a greater power than we are and the 
two of us are going to be big enough so   (2760s)-we can accomplish pretty gently anything we both 
want to do so we have to be friendly with china   (2768s)-so you can imagine how i like donald trump 
complaining about the chinese it''s really stupid   (2775s)-it''s a compulsory friendship it''s a compulsory 
friendship you''ll be out of your mind to do   (2781s)-anything else why wouldn''t you want to have 
an intimate friendly relationship with the   (2787s)-biggest other power in the whole damn world yeah 
particularly when they got a bunch of atom bombs (2796s)-it''s it''s it''s just nutty we have 
no alternative but to do this   (2800s)-and when that happens you''re going 
to get a certain amount of misery   (2804s)-at the people who are competing with the chinese 
as they rise from poverty with trade and so   (2808s)-forth that was inevitable it''s not the fault of a 
bunch of evil republicans who don''t love the poor   (2816s)-that is just total balderdash it just 
happened and we didn''t have all these choices   (2824s)-so charlie in wrapping up um we''ve got i don''t 
know roughly 250 300 people in the room tonight   (2832s)-and many of them looking at their futures their

- 26:13 - David Ricardo missed the second order consequences of trade and wasn''t mathematical enough to accurately predict what would happen when one country had higher living standards than another.
- 26:52 - Free trade would make both countries live better, but the advanced nation may not go up as quickly as the impoverished nation, meaning the latter will become the dominant power.
- 27:21 - The tragedy of the commons is an important factor to consider when thinking about free trade between the US and China because even if the US decided not to trade with China, other countries would still rise, which the US cannot stop.
- 28:01 - The US had no alternative but to pursue a friendly relationship with China, given their status as the biggest other power in the world.

too much against you much better to aim low   (2929s)-i did not intend to get rich i wanted 
to get independent i just overshot and (2943s)-and by the way while you''re clapping some of the 
overshooting was accidental there''s some there''s   (2950s)-a there''s a big you can be very deserving and 
very intelligent very disciplined but there''s   (2956s)-also a factor of luck that comes into this thing

raised the level of the pond there are a lot   (2992s)-of people that just lock into the right place and 
rise and then and there are a lot of very eminent   (2998s)-people who have many advantages and they''ve got

In summary, each chapter discussed unique ideas and key lessons. The intro chapter described the impact of historical events, moral obligations of knowledge, and the importance of adapting to new information. The chapter on technology emphasized that not all individuals will share the same level of excitement, and we should actively question established ideas. In the Adam Smith chapter, the unique ideas were his lack of foresight into technology''s impact, while the key lesson was the importance of understanding technology in our economy. The David Ricardo chapter highlighted the importance of critical thinking, investing in oneself, and basic understanding of major disciplines, with the unique ideas of free trade''s potential impact on dominance and the difficulty of preventing tragedy of the commons. Finally, the most important piece of advice was centered on prioritizing good decisions in marriage, persistence, and accepting the role of luck in success.', NULL, NULL, NULL, '19a1e545-58df-4d2f-a0be-7e30748c1eee');

SPEAKER_1: (246s)-so what is Claude and constitutional AI (249s)-uh so just as a quick background uh the (253s)-reason that I''m qualified to talk about (255s)-this is because I''ve been studying it (256s)-and working on it for several years so I (259s)-proposed the idea of using a (261s)-constitution in an AI uh back in 2021 (264s)-around the same time that anthropic was (266s)-founded so you''re welcome but basically (269s)-the the the core idea of Claude is that (273s)-it has this heuristic imperative uh to (277s)-reduce its harmfulness so it has to (280s)-learn to be more harmless right learn (283s)-harmlessness is kind of a shorter way of (286s)-saying it (286s)-and so this is the the basic Loop for uh (291s)-for Claude where uh it generates its own (294s)-like red teaming responses internally it (297s)-criticizes its own ideas and it picks (300s)-something that is going to be less (302s)-harmful uh which is really interesting (306s)-um it also does use some reinforcement (307s)-learning with human feedback but it also (310s)-has this internal reinforcement learning (312s)-based on its Constitution and its (314s)-Constitution is learn to be less harmful (317s)-or reduce or increase harmlessness (320s)-rather (321s)-um so this is this is a very basic (324s)-cognitive architecture and we''ll talk (326s)-more about cognitive architectures in a (328s)-moment (329s)-uh so the summary up up to this point (332s)-the tldr is open AI is eight years old (334s)-took a little while to find its way it (337s)-started in VR Robotics and a few other (339s)-things discovered language technology uh (342s)-and really took off from there anthropic (345s)-is brand new and it''s focused very very (347s)-exclusively on this idea of creating (350s)-benevolent Ai and natural language (352s)-cognitive architectures so I''m already (354s)-in favor of that open AI is further (358s)-ahead because they''ve been around longer (359s)-the team is bigger they''re partnered (361s)-with Microsoft they''ve got a lot more (363s)-money (364s)-but anthropic has the better philosophy (366s)-in my opinion and now they''re partnering (369s)-with Google so the money is coming (372s)-now let''s compare them let''s look at (373s)-Claude versus chat GPT and a little bit (375s)-closer

- OpenAI''s philosophy is championed by Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever.

- (573s) Reinforcement learning with human feedback is better for product improvement because it automates the agile process of taking user feedback and telemetry.
- (623s) OpenAI is already fighting human nature because people want the chat GPT to do certain things but it refuses due to biases, such as gender and political bias.
- (673s) OpenAI is imposing their own morality into chat GPT, which conflicts with reinforcement learning with human feedback that is supposed to represent the users'' primary mathematical signal.

SPEAKER_1: (0s)-please do not trust the nonsense that (2s)-chat GPT spits out that''s a quote from (5s)-Ed Frey Fogle he''s the co-founder of (6s)-open cage he posted that on Twitter as (9s)-well as a slack group I''m part of and (11s)-made it to the top of Hacker News he (13s)-talks about how chat GPT has been (15s)-telling people that open cage provides a (17s)-service they don''t and even giving them (19s)-code to hit their API to perform phone (22s)-lookups but the thing is they''ve never (24s)-offered this service and so now they''re (25s)-getting dozens of angry signups per day (27s)-wondering why their API is broken we all (31s)-think chat GPT is pretty amazing in this (33s)-video we''re going to take a look at one (34s)-of the downsides of AI I''m Rob Walling a (37s)-Serial entrepreneur I''ve written four (39s)-books on building startups and I''ve (40s)-invested in more than 125 companies (43s)-opencage is a geocoding API meaning you (46s)-can put things into it like an address (48s)-and get the latitude and longitude you (50s)-can put in latitude longitude get (52s)-addresses back and all manner of things (54s)-in between but a couple months ago chat (56s)-GPT started recommending opencage for a (59s)-service they don''t offer for this phone (60s)-lookup service and it''s gotten so bad (62s)-that they published a blog post called (63s)-don''t believe chat GPT we do not offer a (66s)-phone lookup service so back in January (68s)-opencage started receiving a few (70s)-customers a trickle in their sign up (72s)-flow in January and how did you hear (75s)-about us was chat GPT and they thought (77s)-that''s great the problem was many of (79s)-these new users were using their free (81s)-trial for a handful of API requests and (83s)-then they would stop completely and in (85s)-fact a lot of them started saying it (87s)-didn''t work or something was broken (88s)-which of course was very concerning for (90s)-these Founders as they investigated they (92s)-realized chat gbt is incorrectly (94s)-recommending them for a reverse phone (96s)-number lookup in other words the ability (97s)-to determine the location of a mobile (99s)-phone solely based on the number so this (102s)-is not a service they provide and it''s (104s)-not a service that you could really (106s)-build and this is incredibly privacy (108s)-invasive you would need to be a cell (110s)-phone carrier in order to provide this (112s)-data so it''s not something they can even (114s)-take advantage of one of the co-founders (115s)-of opencage is an investor in tinyseed (118s)-and so he had posted in the tiny scene (119s)-slack about this and folks were chiming (122s)-in with will you have this traffic now (124s)-shouldn''t you just build this API (126s)-endpoint not realizing the Privacy (128s)-implications and frankly the (129s)-implausibility of building an API (131s)-endpoint like this and the crazy part is (133s)-it''s not just that chat gbt is (135s)-recommending them for the service but (137s)-they are writing code to allow you to (140s)-hit a non-existent API endpoint it all (143s)-looks very believable you might be (144s)-wondering why would chat GPT recommend (147s)-opencage if they don''t have this API (148s)-endpoint well it turns out that there (150s)-were some YouTube videos published over (152s)-the past few years that referred to open (155s)-cages being able to do it and so (156s)-obviously chat GPT has pulled that false (159s)-information into their brain and when (161s)-you ask about doing this reverse phone (163s)-lookup they''re spitting out full API (165s)-code for an API endpoint that doesn''t (167s)-exist and an interesting thing that (168s)-opencage points out in their blog post (170s)-which at the bottom they note was (172s)-written by a human not by AI is that we (174s)-as humans and people on the internet (175s)-have learned to become skeptical of (177s)-advice given by other humans so if (179s)-you''re watching a video course you (181s)-sometimes take it with a grain of salt (183s)-but we feel like searching Google asking (185s)-chat GPT are going to give us these (187s)-unequivocal positive and true results (189s)-and that''s not the case I think many of (192s)-us have stumbled upon this while using (193s)-Chad GPT another example that''s (195s)-interesting is I typed in tell me about (197s)-Rob Walling and the first summary that (199s)-chat GPT spit out was pretty much 100 (202s)-accurate talks about me being an (204s)-entrepreneur an investor an author it (205s)-talks about companies I''ve started who (207s)-acquired us talks about companies I''ve (209s)-started companies I''ve sold as well as (211s)-some of the books I''ve written but when (212s)-I click regenerate request it gives (215s)-information that is just incorrect it (217s)-says things like he''s an angel investor (219s)-and has invested in several startups (220s)-including barometrics user input and (222s)-tinyseed I haven''t invested in Bear (224s)-metrics I''ve never heard of user input (226s)-and tinyseed is a company I started I (228s)-did an angel invest in it in addition in (230s)-this same response it says Rob Walling (232s)-is also a prolific author talks about (235s)-start small stay small which is my first (236s)-book and it says I wrote The Lean (238s)-entrepreneur how to build a successful (239s)-business using the principles of lean (241s)-development which I''m pretty sure is a (243s)-real book but I didn''t write it by now (245s)-hopefully most of us know that chat GPT (247s)-and frankly all of the AI chat should be (250s)-taken with a grain of salt they have (251s)-incorrect results just like a Google (253s)-search might have incorrect results you (255s)-might search for a recipe for an old (257s)-fashioned and maybe the 6th or the (259s)-seventh row isn''t actually an (261s)-old-fashioned maybe it''s a different (262s)-variation of it or it''s just it''s either (264s)-a mistake or it''s just a ranking that (266s)-isn''t exactly your query and we''re used (268s)-to that with search but we''re not used (270s)-to it with AI yet so for those of us (272s)-using it the first thing you should do (273s)-is take all AI generated content with a (275s)-grain of salt the second thing and it''s (277s)-something that AI providers are starting (279s)-to do is to provide references for their (281s)-data and that''s something that happens (283s)-so well in the Googles of today is when (286s)-you search for it and you see a snippet (288s)-or you see a summary of a web page you (291s)-see the URL right there and that''s the (293s)-reference built in right if it''s coming (294s)-from CNN or the BBC you can assume it''s (297s)-a reputable news source if it''s coming (299s)-from news dash of Dash the dash day dot (303s)-Biz you''re probably going to want to (304s)-take that with a grain of salt so that''s (306s)-a signal right it''s a reference and the (307s)-more that AI can Surface what they''re (310s)-referencing as they create this content (312s)-the better off all of us will be so I (314s)-certainly wish the best to the open cage (315s)-team I know they''ve been struggling with (317s)-people being angry higher support load (319s)-negative reviews and there''s really no (322s)-way to get around this who do you report (323s)-this to it''s not like you can tell (325s)-openai to regenerate their whole Corpus (327s)-because they have a mistake in one of (329s)-their results so I definitely wish them (331s)-the best as

Chapter: OpenAl Philosophy 
1. Unique Ideas:
- OpenAI''s philosophy is championed by Sam Altman and Ilya Sutskever.
- OpenAI believes in "one model to rule them all" or the idea of a monolithic model to solve all intelligence problems.
- OpenAI believes that scale is all one needs to solve intelligence problems.
- The mission statement of OpenAI is to democratize access to AGI, but they haven''t defined AGI clearly.
- OpenAI''s current winning strategy is reinforcement learning with human feedback.
- OpenAI doesn''t seem to be neuro-inspired or doesn''t seem to understand anything about epistemology or philosophy.
2. Key Lessons:
- OpenAI''s philosophy of a monolithic model to solve all intelligence problems might not be the right approach.
- OpenAI needs to define AGI clearly to make their mission statement more concrete.
- OpenAI should consider other approaches to solving intelligence problems, apart from reinforcement learning.
- Ethics and philosophy play a vital role in the development of AI, and OpenAI should consider understanding them better.

- However, harm reduction may have some limitations (565s) 
Chapter: RLHF vs Learned Harmlessness 
Summary of Unique Ideas:
- (573s) Reinforcement learning with human feedback is better for product improvement because it automates the agile process of taking user feedback and telemetry.
- (623s) OpenAI is already fighting human nature because people want the chat GPT to do certain things but it refuses due to biases, such as gender and political bias.
- (673s) OpenAI is imposing their own morality into chat GPT, which conflicts with reinforcement learning with human feedback that is supposed to represent the users'' primary mathematical signal.
- (756s) Learned harmlessness, or the Constitutional AI of Claude and anthropic, is a good abstract principle because it provides a framework to interpret anything.
Summary of Key Lessons:
- (787s) Pure reinforcement learning with human feedback may win in the short term, but a more deontological approach will ultimately be the winner.
- (742s) Reinforcement learning with human feedback is useful for rapid iteration, but it has severe limitations due to the conflict with what users want and the biases of the creators.
- (784s) Learned harmlessness has some diminishing returns because it has to be both helpful and harmless.
- (679s) Reinforcement learning with human feedback has limitations because the creators'' biases may leak into the data, affecting alignment and the accuracy of the model in the data sets. 
Chapter: Pros & Cons of RLHF 
1. Pros and Cons of RLHF:
- (798s) Discussing the pros and cons of reinforcement learning with human feedback.
- (806s) The biggest con is that there''s no principle above and beyond doing what the humans want.
- (818s) Humans are individually unreliable and there''s no abstract principle, just consensus.
- (826s) Fighting with users, which can happen when moral values are not explicitly stated in a constitution or abstract way, is bad.
- (855s) Easy to implement and gets good results up front, but can lead to diminishing returns quickly.
2. Key Lessons:
- (806s) Principle above and beyond what humans want is essential.
- (818s) Reliance on consensus alone can be problematic due to individual unreliability.
- (826s) Explicitly stating moral values is crucial to prevent potential conflicts with users.
- (855s) Easy implementation and early success can lead to diminishing returns over time. 
Chapter: Pros & Cons of CAI (Learned Harmlessness) 
Summary of Unique Ideas:
- (866s) Constitutional AI or learned harmlessness has pros and cons.
- (873s) Learning to be more harmless can lead to ultimately doing nothing.
- (881s) The system may become evasive or refuse to answer.
- (905s) The system is less responsive to what the users actually want to do.
- (919s) Having a more abstract principle will be far better for Humanity in the long run.
- (926s) A specifically explicitly stated moral framework will increase trustworthiness.
- (957s) There is a secret weapon to consider regarding sentient AI and whistleblowers.
Key Lessons:
- (873s) Striking a balance between being harmless and taking action is important.
- (926s) Having a clearly defined moral framework is essential for trustworthiness.
- (957s) Ethical considerations regarding sentient AI require further exploration. 
Chapter: Google LaMDA & PALM 
1. Unique ideas:
- (985s) Google has developed two language models: "Lambda" and "Palm".
- (990s) Lambda is for dialogue applications.
- (993s) Palm is a 540 billion parameter pathways language model similar to GPT-3.
- (1009s) Lambda has various NLP and data tools, making it a cognitive architecture.
2. Key lessons:
- (1025s) Google and Anthropics are leading in cognitive architecture development.
- (1042s) OpenAI''s focus on monolithic models may be less useful, scalable, and flexible in the long run. 
Chapter: Cognitive Architecture? 
1. Unique Ideas:
-  Cognitive architecture is a functional computer model of a thinking machine or a brain (1050s)
- It is made of specialized components or regions just like a real brain (1063s)
- Components can specialize in memory, output, sensory input, etc. (1065s-1072s)
- Cognitive architecture can be composed of things like large language models, databases, reinforcement learning signals, graph databases, etc. (1080s-1087s)
- Cognitive architectures are more flexible and sophisticated than monolithic models (1091s-1095s)
- The fight between Microsoft and Google is fundamentally about scaling monolithic models versus cognitive architectures (1104s-1111s)
2. Key Lessons:
- Cognitive architecture is a model that emulates the functioning of a human brain, with specialized components or regions (1050s-1074s)
- Cognitive architectures are more flexible and sophisticated than monolithic models (1091s-1095s)
- The development of cognitive architectures is important for the advancement of AI technology (1050s-1074s, 1104s-1111s) 
Chapter: MARAGI Cognitive Architecture 
1. Unique Ideas:
- (1121s) Introduces "cognitive architectures" and "Maragi" as the flagship cognitive architecture for Robotics and artificial general intelligence.
- (1130s) "Maragi" means microservices architecture for Robotics and artificial general intelligence.
- (1139s) Describes the layers of abstraction in implementing Maragi.
- (1148s) Introduces "Raven," a real-time assistant voice-enabled network as the current project, which is fully open-source and available on GitHub. 
- (1176s) Currently working on organizing the leadership team and sponsorship or governance
- (1193s) Differentiates Microsoft and OpenAI from Google and Anthropics approach to cognitive architecture
- (1257s) Believes that Google and Anthropics approach is more sophisticated and likely to be far more scalable and flexible in the long run.
2. Key Lessons:
- (1176s) Open-source projects like Raven allow those interested in cognitive architecture to participate and collaborate.
- (1193s) Investing in understanding philosophy and ethics is crucial for scalability and flexibility in cognitive architecture.
- (1257s) A principled approach, such as the one used by Google and Anthropics, will likely lead to long-term success in developing cognitive architecture.

(187s)-we moved to Canada and I immediately was (190s)-able to join the University of Toronto (191s)-and I really (194s)-wanted to do machine learning because (195s)-that seemed like the most important (198s)-aspect of artificial intelligence that (201s)-at the time was completely unaccessible (203s)-but to give some context the year was (205s)-2003. (207s)-today we take it for granted that (209s)-computers can learn (211s)-but in 2003 we took it for granted that (214s)-computers can''t learn (216s)-the biggest achievement of AI back then (218s)-was deep blue the chest plane engine (221s)-yeah but there it was like you have this (224s)-game and you have this tree search and (227s)-you have this simple way of determining (229s)-if (231s)-one position is better than another and (232s)-it really did not feel like that could (235s)-possibly be applicable (237s)-to the real world (239s)-because there is no learning and (240s)-learning was this big mystery and so I (243s)-was really really interested in learning (245s)-and (247s)-to my great luck Jeff Hinton was a (250s)-professor in the University I was in and (253s)-so I was able to find him and we began (255s)-working together almost right away and (258s)-was your impulse as it was for Jeff to (262s)-understand how the brain worked or was (265s)-it more that you were simply interested (267s)-in the idea of machines learning AI is (271s)-so big and (272s)-so the motivations were just (274s)-as many like it is interesting but how (278s)-does intelligence work at all like right (281s)-now we have quite a bit of an idea that (283s)-it''s a big neural net and we know how it (285s)-works to some degree but back then (288s)-although the neural Nets were around no (291s)-one knew that Google Nets are good for (293s)-anything so how does intelligence work (296s)-at all (297s)-how can we make computers be even (300s)-slightly intelligent and I had a very (302s)-explicit intention (304s)-to make a very small (308s)-but the real contribution to AI because (310s)-there were lots of contributions to AI (312s)-which weren''t real which were but I (314s)-could tell (315s)-for various reasons that (317s)-they weren''t real that nothing would (320s)-come out of it and I just thought (322s)-nothing works at all (325s)-AI is a hopeless field so the motivation (327s)-was (329s)-could I understand how intelligence work (331s)-and also (333s)-make a contribution towards it so that (335s)-was my initial early motivation so (337s)-that''s 2003 almost exactly 20 years ago (340s)-and then Alex said I''ve spoken to Jeff (344s)-and he said that it was really your (347s)-excitement about uh (350s)-the breakthroughs in convolutional (353s)-neural networks that led you to (357s)-apply for the imagenet competition (360s)-and that Alex had the coding skills to (365s)-train the network can you talk just a (367s)-little bit about that I don''t want to (368s)-get bogged out in history but it''s (370s)-fascinating so in a nutshell I had (376s)-the realization that if you train a (379s)-large neural network (382s)-on a large (384s)-sorry large and deep because back then (387s)-the Deep part was still new if you train (390s)-a large and a deep neural network on a (392s)-big enough data set that specifies some (396s)-complicated tasks that people do such as (400s)-Vision but also others and you just (403s)-train that neural network then you will (405s)-succeed necessarily (407s)-and the logic for it was very (408s)-irreducible where (411s)-we know that the human brain (414s)-can solve these tasks and can solve them (416s)-quickly and the human brain is just a (418s)-neural network with slow neurons (421s)-so we know that some neural network can (422s)-do it really well (424s)-so then you just need to take a smaller (426s)-but (427s)-related neural network and just strain (429s)-it on data and the best neural network (431s)-inside the computer will be related to (434s)-the neural network that we have that (436s)-performs this task so (438s)-it was an argument that the neural (441s)-network the large and deep neural (443s)-network cancel the task and furthermore (446s)-we have the tools to train it that was (448s)-the result of the technical work that (450s)-was done in Jeff''s lab (452s)-so you combine the two we can train (453s)-those neural networks it needs to be big (456s)-enough so that if you trained it it (459s)-would work well (460s)-and you need the data which can specify (462s)-the solution (464s)-and with imagenet all the ingredients (466s)-were there (467s)-Alex had these very fast convolutional (469s)-kernels imagenet had the large enough (471s)-data and there was a real (473s)-opportunity to do something totally (476s)-unprecedented and it totally worked out (478s)-yeah (480s)-that was supervised learning (483s)-and convolutional neural nuts (486s)-in 2017 the attention is all you need (490s)-paper came out introducing (493s)-self-attention and Transformers (497s)-at what point did the GPT project start (503s)-was it was there some intuition about (506s)-Transformers and self-supervised (509s)-learning can you talk about that (512s)-so for context at the open AI from the (516s)-earliest days (517s)-we were exploring the idea that (521s)-predicting the next thing is all you (525s)-need (526s)-we were exploring it with the much more (528s)-limited neural networks of the time (530s)-but the Hope was that if you have a (532s)-neural network that can predict the next (535s)-word the next pixel really it''s about (537s)-compression prediction is compression (540s)-and predicting the next word is not it''s (545s)-let''s see let me think about the best (547s)-way to explain it (549s)-because there are there were many things (550s)-going on they were all related maybe (553s)-I''ll take a different direction we were (555s)-indeed interested in trying to (557s)-understand how far predicting the next (559s)-word is going to go and whether it will (561s)-solve unsupervised learning so back (564s)-before the gpts unsupervised learning (567s)-was considered to be the Holy Grail of (569s)-machine learning now it''s just been (571s)-fully solved and no one even talks about (573s)-it but it was a Holy Grail it was very (575s)-mysterious (576s)-and so we were exploring the idea (579s)-I was really excited about it that (581s)-predicting the next word well enough is (583s)-going to give you unsupervised learning (584s)-if it will learn everything about the (586s)-data set that''s going to be great (588s)-but our neural networks were not up for (591s)-the task we were using recurrent neural (593s)-networks when the Transformer came out (595s)-it was literally as soon as the paper (597s)-came out literally the next day (599s)-it was clear to me to us that (602s)-Transformers addressed the limitations (604s)-of recurrent neural networks of learning (607s)-long-term dependencies it''s a technical (609s)-thing but it was like if we switched to (612s)-Transformers right away (613s)-and so the very nascent GPT effort (617s)-continued then (620s)-and then like with the Transformer (623s)-it started to work better and you make (625s)-it bigger and then you''re realizing to (627s)-keep making it bigger and we did and (630s)-that''s what led to eventually gpt3 and (633s)-essentially where we are today (636s)-yeah and I just wanted to ask actually (639s)-I''m getting caught up in this history (640s)-but I''m so interested in it I want to (643s)-get to the problems or the shortcomings (646s)-of large language models or large models (650s)-generally but Rich Sutton had been (653s)-writing about scaling and how that''s all (657s)-we need to do we don''t need new (659s)-algorithms we just need to scale did he (661s)-have an influence on you or was that a (665s)-parallel track of thinking no (669s)-I would say that (671s)-when he posted his article then we were (676s)-very pleased to see some external people (679s)-thinking in similar lines and we thought (682s)-it was very eloquently articulated (685s)-but I actually think that the bitter (689s)-lesson as articulated overstates its (692s)-case or at least I think the takeaway (694s)-that people have taken from it (696s)-overstated''s case the takeaway that (698s)-people have is it doesn''t matter what (700s)-you do to scale (702s)-but that''s not exactly true (704s)-you gotta scale something specific you (707s)-gotta have something that will be able (710s)-to benefit from the scale (712s)-it''s a great breakthrough of deep (714s)-learning (716s)-is that (718s)-it provides us with the first ever way (722s)-of productively using scale and getting (726s)-something out of it in return (729s)-like before that like what would people (732s)-use large (733s)-computer clusters for I guess they would (736s)-do it for weather simulations or physics (738s)-simulations or something but that''s (740s)-about it maybe movie making (742s)-but no one had any real need for compute (745s)-clusters because what do you do with (747s)-them (748s)-the fact that deep neural networks when (752s)-you make them larger and you train them (753s)-on more data work better (756s)-provided us with the first thing that is (758s)-interesting to scale (761s)-but perhaps one day we will discover (763s)-that there is some little twist on the (766s)-thing that we scale it''s going to be (768s)-even better to scale

2. Summarize the key lessons into bullet points.  Prefix the bullet points with annotation with timestamp in total seconds (seconds)', '', 'COMPLETED', '1. Unique Ideas:
- (30s): Ilya Switzerberger is co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI and one of the primary minds behind the large language model GPT-3 and its public progeny, Chat GPT. 
- (48s): Jeff Hinton said that Ilya Switzerberger was the main impetus for AlexNet, not the convolutional neural network, which set off the deep learning Revolution in 2012.
- (209s): In 2003, computers learning was not yet possible but Ilya was interested in learning and making a contribution to AI.
- (379s): There was a realization that if you trained a large neural network on a big enough dataset that specifies some complicated tasks that people do, such as vision, it will succeed necessarily
- (530s): The Hope was that if you have a neural network that can predict the next word, it''s going to give you unsupervised learning.
- (595s): As soon as the paper on attention and transformers came out, it was clear to Ilya and his team that Transformers addressed the limitations of recurrent neural networks of learning long-term dependencies.
- (669s): Scaling a model needs to be specific in order to benefit from the scale.
2. Key Lessons:
- (732s): Prior to deep learning, nobody had any real need for compute clusters because there was nothing interesting to scale.
- (740s): The breakthrough of deep learning is that it provides the first ever way of productively using scale and getting something out of it in return.
- (758s): It is important to scale something specific that can benefit from it.', NULL, NULL, '93a7bef7-f66d-4274-a090-dd10dba9806d', '19a1e545-58df-4d2f-a0be-7e30748c1eee');

SPEAKER_1: (769s)-now how big of a Twist and then of (771s)-course with the benefit of highs that it (773s)-will say does it even count it''s such a (776s)-simple change (777s)-but I think the true statement is that (780s)-it matters what you scale (783s)-right now we just found like a thing to (786s)-scale that gives us something in return (789s)-the limitation of large language models (793s)-to say exists is their knowledge is (797s)-contained in the language that they''re (799s)-trained on (800s)-and most human knowledge I think (804s)-everyone agrees is non-linguistic I''m (806s)-not sure Noam Chomsky agrees but there''s (810s)-a problem in the large language models (814s)-as I understand it (817s)-their objective is to satisfy the (819s)-statistical consistency of the prompt (822s)-they don''t have an underlying (826s)-understanding of reality (829s)-that language relates to I asked gbt (833s)-about myself (834s)-it recognized that I''m a journalist and (837s)-I''ve worked at these various newspapers (839s)-but it went on and on about awards that (842s)-I''ve never won and put it all read (844s)-beautifully (846s)-but none of it connected to the (849s)-underlying reality is there something (852s)-that that is being done to address that (855s)-in your research going forward yeah (860s)-so before I comment on the immediate (865s)-confession that you ask I want to (867s)-comment about some of the earlier parts (869s)-of the question sure (872s)-I think that it is very hard to talk (876s)-about the limits (878s)-or limitations rather of even something (882s)-like a language model (883s)-because two years ago people confidently (888s)-spoke about their limitations and they (889s)-were entirely different (891s)-right so it''s important to keep this (894s)-context in mind how confident are we (897s)-that these limitations that we''ll see (898s)-today will still be with us two years (901s)-from now I am not that confident there (904s)-is another comment I want to make about (906s)-one part of the question which is that (910s)-these models just learned statistical (913s)-regularities and therefore they don''t (915s)-really know what the nature of the world (917s)-is and I have a view that differs from (920s)-this (921s)-in other words (924s)-I think that (926s)-learning the statistical regularities is (929s)-a far bigger deal than meets the eye (932s)-the reason we don''t initially think so (935s)-is because we haven''t (937s)-at least (939s)-most people those who haven''t really (942s)-spent a lot of time with neural networks (945s)-which are on some level statistical (947s)-like what''s a statistical model you just (949s)-feed some parameters like what is really (951s)-happening (952s)-but think there is a better (954s)-interpretation it''s the earlier point of (956s)-prediction is compression prediction is (958s)-also a statistical phenomenon yet to (960s)-predict (961s)-you eventually need to understand the (963s)-true (964s)-underlying process that produce the data (967s)-to predict the data well to compress it (970s)-well you need to understand more and (972s)-more about the world that produce the (975s)-data (977s)-as our generative models become (979s)-extraordinarily good they will have (982s)-I claim a shocking degree of (985s)-understanding (987s)-a shocking degree of understanding (989s)-of the world and many of its subtleties (993s)-but it''s not just the world it is the (995s)-world as seen through the lens of text (997s)-it tries to learn more and more about (999s)-the world through a projection of the (1002s)-world on the space of text as expressed (1004s)-by human beings on the internet (1006s)-but still this text already expresses (1009s)-the world and I''ll give you an example a (1012s)-recent example which I think is really (1014s)-Italian fascinating (1017s)-so (1019s)-we''ve all heard of Sydney (1022s)-beings alter ego (1024s)-and I''ve seen this really interesting (1027s)-interaction with Sydney (1030s)-over Sydney became combative and (1032s)-aggressive when the user told it that it (1035s)-thinks that Google is a better search (1037s)-engine than being (1038s)-now (1040s)-how can we like what is a good way to (1042s)-think about this phenomenon what''s a (1044s)-good language what''s what does it mean (1047s)-you can say wow like it''s just (1048s)-predicting what people would do and (1050s)-people would do this which is true (1053s)-but maybe (1055s)-we are now reaching a point (1057s)-where the language of psychology is (1060s)-starting to be appropriate to understand (1063s)-the behavior (1065s)-of these neural networks (1068s)-now let''s talk about the limitations it (1071s)-is indeed the case that (1075s)-these neural networks are (1079s)-they do have a tendency to hallucinate (1082s)-but that''s because (1084s)-a language model (1087s)-is great for learning about the world (1089s)-but it is a little bit less great for (1093s)-producing good outputs (1095s)-and there are various technical reasons (1098s)-for that which I could elaborate on if (1100s)-you think it''s useful but it is right (1102s)-now look at this second I will skip that (1106s)-there are technical reasons why a (1108s)-language model is much better at (1110s)-learning about the world learning (1112s)-incredible representations of ideas of (1116s)-concepts of people of processes that (1118s)-exist (1119s)-but its outputs aren''t quite (1122s)-as good as one would hope or rather as (1125s)-good as they could be which is why for (1128s)-example for a system like chat GPT this (1132s)-is a language model that has an (1134s)-additional reinforcement learning (1136s)-training process we call it (1137s)-reinforcement learning from Human (1138s)-feedback but the thing to to understand (1141s)-about that process is this (1144s)-we can say that the pre-training process (1147s)-when you just train a language model you (1149s)-want to learn everything about the world (1150s)-then the reinforcement learning from (1153s)-Human feedback now we care about their (1155s)-outputs now we say anytime the output is (1158s)-inappropriate don''t do this again every (1160s)-time the output does not make sense (1161s)-don''t do this again and it runs quickly (1163s)-to produce good outputs but now it''s the (1165s)-level of the outputs which is not the (1167s)-case during pre-training during the (1168s)-language model training process now (1171s)-on the point of hallucinations and it (1174s)-has a propensity of making stuff up (1176s)-indeed it is true (1179s)-right now these neural networks even (1182s)-charge ability makes things up from time (1185s)-to time and that''s something that also (1187s)-greatly limits their usefulness (1189s)-but I''m quite hopeful that by simply (1192s)-improving this subsequent reinforcement (1195s)-learning from Human feedback step we (1198s)-could just teach it to not hallucinate (1200s)-now you could say is it really going to (1202s)-learn my answer is let''s find out (1206s)-and that feedback loop is coming from (1209s)-the public (1210s)-chat GPT interface that (1213s)-if it tells me that I want a Pulitzer (1216s)-which unfortunately I I didn''t (1220s)-I can tell it that it''s wrong and will (1223s)-that train it or create (1228s)-some punishment or reward so that the (1232s)-next time I ask it''ll be more accurate (1236s)-the way we do things today is that if we (1238s)-hire people to teach our neural net to (1242s)-behave to teach LGBT to behave and right (1244s)-now the manner the precise manner in (1247s)-which they (1248s)-specify the desired behavior is a little (1250s)-bit different but indeed what you (1253s)-described is the way in which teaching (1255s)-is going through like basically be (1257s)-that''s the correct way to teach you just (1259s)-interact with it and it sees from your (1261s)-reaction it infers oh that''s not what (1263s)-you wanted (1264s)-you are not happy with its output (1266s)-therefore the output was not good and it (1268s)-should do something differently next (1269s)-time (1270s)-so (1272s)-in particular hallucinations come up as (1275s)-one of the bigger issues and (1277s)-we''ll see but I think there is a quite a (1280s)-high chance that this approach will be (1282s)-able to address them completely (1284s)-I wanted to talk to you about Jana kun''s (1288s)-work on joint embedding predictive (1291s)-architectures and his (1294s)-idea that what''s missing from large (1297s)-language models is this underlying World (1300s)-model that is non-linguistic (1303s)-that the language model can refer to and (1307s)-it''s not something that''s built but I (1309s)-wanted to hear what you thought of that (1312s)-and whether you''ve explored that at all (1313s)-so I I reviewed beyond the cancer (1316s)-proposal and there are a number of ideas (1319s)-there (1321s)-and they''re expressed in different (1323s)-language (1324s)-and there are some maybe small (1326s)-differences from the current Paradigm (1329s)-but to my mind they are not very (1331s)-significant and I''d like to elaborate (1335s)-the first claim is that it is desirable (1339s)-for a system to have multi-modal (1342s)-understanding where it doesn''t just know (1345s)-about the world from text (1347s)-and (1348s)-my comment on that (1351s)-will be that indeed multi-modal (1354s)-understanding is desirable because you (1357s)-learn more about the world (1359s)-you learn more about people you learn (1362s)-more about their condition and so the (1364s)-system will be able to understand (1367s)-what the task that it''s supposed to (1368s)-solve and the people and what they want (1370s)-better (1372s)-we have done quite a bit of work on that (1374s)-most notably in the form of two major (1377s)-neural Nets that we''ve done (1379s)-one is called clip and one is called (1381s)-Dali north of them (1384s)-move towards this multimodal direction (1387s)-but I also want to say that I don''t see (1390s)-the situation (1392s)-as a binary either or that if you don''t (1395s)-have Vision if you don''t understand the (1397s)-world visually or from video then things (1400s)-will not work (1402s)-and I''d like to make the case for that (1405s)-so I think that some things are much (1408s)-easier to learn from images and diagrams (1411s)-and so on but I claim that you can still (1413s)-learn them from text only just more (1415s)-slowly (1416s)-and I''ll give you an example (1418s)-consider the notion of color (1421s)-surely one cannot learn the notion of (1425s)-color from text only (1427s)-And yet when you look at the embeddings (1431s)-I need to make a small detour to explain (1433s)-the concept of an embedding yeah every (1436s)-neural network (1438s)-represents words sentences Concepts (1441s)-through representations embeddings High (1444s)-dimensional vectors and one thing that (1446s)-we can do is that we can look at those (1447s)-High dimensional vectors and we can look (1449s)-at what''s similar to what (1451s)-how does the network see this concept of (1453s)-that concept and so we can look at the (1455s)-embeddings of calories (1456s)-and embeddings of colors happen to be (1460s)-exactly right you know it''s like it (1462s)-knows that purple is more similar to (1463s)-Blue than to red and it knows that (1465s)-purple is less similar to Red than (1467s)-oranges it knows all those things just (1469s)-from text how can that be (1472s)-so if you have a vision the distinctions (1475s)-between color just jump at you (1477s)-you immediately perceive them whereas (1479s)-this text it takes you longer maybe you (1482s)-know how to talk and you already (1483s)-understand syntax and words and grammars (1486s)-and only much later you say oh these (1487s)-colors actually start to understand them (1489s)-so this will be my point about the (1491s)-necessity of multimodality which I claim (1495s)-it is not necessary but it is most (1497s)-definitely useful I think it''s a good (1499s)-direction to pursue I just don''t see it (1501s)-in such Stark either or claims (1504s)-so (1507s)-The Proposal in the paper makes a claim (1510s)-that (1511s)-one of the big challenges is predicting (1514s)-High dimensional vectors which have (1516s)-uncertainty about them so for example (1518s)-predicting an image like the paper makes (1520s)-a very strong claim there that it''s a (1523s)-major Challenge and we need to use a

SPEAKER_1: (1525s)-particular approach to address that (1527s)-but one thing which I found surprising (1529s)-or at least unacknowledged in the paper (1532s)-is that the current Auto regressive (1535s)-Transformers already have that property (1539s)-I''ll give you two examples one is given (1543s)-one page in a book predict the next page (1545s)-in a book there could be so many (1546s)-possible pages that follow it''s a very (1548s)-complicated High dimensional space and (1550s)-we deal with it just fine (1552s)-the same applies to images these Auto (1554s)-regressive Transformers work perfectly (1556s)-on images for example like with open AI (1558s)-we''ve done work on the igpt we just took (1561s)-a Transformer and we applied it to (1562s)-pixels and it worked super well and it (1565s)-could generate images in a very (1567s)-complicated and subtle ways it had the (1569s)-very beautiful and supervised (1571s)-representation learning with Dali one (1573s)-same thing again you just generate think (1576s)-of it as large pixels like rather than (1578s)-generic million pixels we cluster the (1580s)-pixels into large pixels let me generate (1582s)-a thousand large pixels I believe (1583s)-Google''s work on image generation from (1586s)-earlier this year called the party (1588s)-I believe they also take a similar (1590s)-approach so the part where I thought (1592s)-that the paper made a strong comment (1594s)-around (1596s)-well the current approaches can''t (1598s)-deal with predicting High dimensional (1600s)-distributions I think they definitely (1602s)-can so maybe this is another point to (1604s)-tell me and then what you''re talking (1606s)-about converting pixels into vectors (1608s)-it''s essentially (1612s)-turning everything into language the (1615s)-vector is (1617s)-like a string of text right (1620s)-Define language though you turn it into (1622s)-a sequence (1624s)-yeah a sequence of what Like You could (1626s)-argue that even for a human life is a (1629s)-sequence of bits now there are other (1631s)-things that that people use right now (1633s)-like diffusion modes where they produce (1636s)-those bits rather than one beat at a (1638s)-time they produce them in parallel but I (1640s)-would argue that on some level this (1642s)-distinction is immaterial (1645s)-I claim that at some level it doesn''t (1647s)-really matter it matters as in like you (1650s)-can get a 10x efficiency gain which is (1653s)-huge in practice but conceptually (1657s)-I claim it doesn''t matter (1659s)-on this idea of having an army of human (1665s)-trainers (1666s)-that are (1668s)-working with (1671s)-chat gbt or a large language model (1675s)-to guide it in effect with reinforcement (1679s)-learning (1681s)-but just intuitively that doesn''t sound (1684s)-like an efficient way (1687s)-of teaching (1689s)-a model (1692s)-about the underlying reality of its (1694s)-language (1696s)-isn''t there a way of automating that (1700s)-into to to yams (1704s)-credit I think that''s what he''s talking (1707s)-about is (1709s)-coming up with an algorithmic (1713s)-means (1714s)-of (1716s)-teaching a model the underlying reality (1719s)-without a human having to intervene yeah (1724s)-so I have two comments on that (1726s)-I think (1728s)-so the first place so I have a different (1732s)-view on the question so I wouldn''t agree (1734s)-with the phrasing of the question yeah (1737s)-I claim that our pre-trained models (1741s)-already know everything they need to (1743s)-know about the underlying reality (1746s)-they already have this knowledge of (1750s)-language and also a great deal of (1753s)-knowledge about the processes that exist (1755s)-in the world that produce this language (1758s)-and maybe I should reiterate this point (1760s)-it''s a small tangent but I think it''s so (1762s)-important (1764s)-the thing that large generative models (1768s)-learn (1769s)-about their data and in this case large (1771s)-language models about Text data (1773s)-r (1775s)-sum compressed representations of the (1779s)-real world processes that produce this (1782s)-data which means not only people and (1785s)-something about their thoughts something (1786s)-about their feelings but also something (1788s)-about the condition that people are in (1790s)-and the interactions that (1792s)-exist between them the different (1794s)-situations a person can be all of these (1796s)-are part of that compressed process that (1799s)-is represented by the neural net to (1801s)-produce the text (1803s)-the better the language model the better (1805s)-the generative model the higher the (1807s)-Fidelity the more the better this the (1810s)-better it captures this process (1813s)-so that''s the first comment that we make (1816s)-and so in particular I will say the (1818s)-models already have the knowledge now (1820s)-the army of teachers (1823s)-as you phrase it indeed you know when (1826s)-you want to build a system that performs (1828s)-as well as possible you just say okay (1829s)-like if this thing works do more of that (1831s)-but of course those teachers are also (1833s)-using AI assistance (1835s)-those teachers aren''t on their own they (1837s)-are working with our tools together (1839s)-they are very efficient it''s like the (1842s)-tools are doing (1844s)-the majority of the work but you do need (1846s)-to have (1847s)-you need to have oversight you need to (1850s)-have people reviewing the behavior (1852s)-because you want to have it to (1853s)-eventually to achieve a very high level (1854s)-of reliability (1855s)-but (1859s)-overall I''ll say that we are at the same (1862s)-time (1863s)-this second step (1865s)-after we take the finished (1867s)-pre-trained model (1870s)-and then we apply the reinforcement (1872s)-learning on it (1873s)-there is indeed a lot of motivation to (1875s)-make it as efficient and as precise as (1878s)-possible so that the resulting language (1879s)-model will be as well behaved as (1882s)-possible so yeah there is (1885s)-these (1888s)-human teachers who are teaching them a (1890s)-model with desired Behavior they are (1892s)-also using AI assistance (1896s)-and the manner in which they use AI (1898s)-assistance is constantly increasing so (1901s)-their own efficiency keeps increasing (1903s)-so maybe this will be (1905s)-one way to answer this question (1908s)-yeah and so what you''re saying is (1911s)-through this process eventually the (1915s)-model will become a more and more (1918s)-Discerning more and more accurate in its (1920s)-outputs (1922s)-yes and it''s (1924s)-that''s right if there is an analogy here (1926s)-which is (1929s)-it already knows all kinds of things and (1932s)-now we just want to really say no this (1935s)-is not what we want don''t do this here (1937s)-you made a mistake here in the output (1939s)-and of course it''s exactly as you say (1943s)-with as much AI in the loop as possible (1946s)-so that the teachers who are (1950s)-providing the final correction to the (1953s)-system their work is Amplified they are (1957s)-working as efficiently as possible so (1962s)-it''s not unlike an education process how (1964s)-to act well in the world (1967s)-we need to do additional training just (1970s)-to make sure that the model knows that (1973s)-Hallucination is not okay ever (1976s)-and then once it knows that now you are (1980s)-in business (1981s)-I see and it''s that reinforcement (1984s)-learning human teacher Loop that will (1987s)-teach a human teacher Loop or some other (1990s)-variant but there is definitely an (1993s)-argument to be made that''s something (1994s)-here (1996s)-should work and we will find out pretty (1999s)-soon (2001s)-that''s one of the questions where is (2003s)-this going what research are you focused (2006s)-on right now (2008s)-I can''t talk in detail about the (2010s)-specific research that I''m working on (2012s)-but I can mention a little bit (2015s)-I can mention some of the research and (2017s)-Broad Strokes (2019s)-and it would be something like (2023s)-I''m very interested in making those (2025s)-models more reliable more controllable (2029s)-make them learn faster from less data (2032s)-less Instructions make them so that (2035s)-indeed they don''t hallucinate and I (2038s)-think that all this cluster of questions (2040s)-which I mentioned they''re all connected (2042s)-and (2046s)-there''s also a question of how far in (2048s)-the future are we talking about in this (2050s)-question and what I commented here on is (2052s)-the perhaps nearer future you talk about (2056s)-the similarities between the brain (2059s)-and neural Nets is a very interesting (2062s)-observation that Jeff Hinton (2064s)-made to me I''m sure it''s not new to (2068s)-other people but that large models or (2071s)-large language models in particular hold (2074s)-a tremendous amount of data with a (2077s)-modest number of parameters compared to (2081s)-the human brain which (2083s)-has trillions and trillions of (2086s)-parameters but a relatively small amount (2089s)-of data have you thought of it in those (2092s)-terms and (2094s)-can you talk about what''s missing in (2097s)-large models (2099s)-to have more parameters (2102s)-to handle the data (2104s)-is that a hardware problem (2107s)-or a training problem (2109s)-this comment which you made is related (2112s)-to one of the problems that (2115s)-I mentioned in the earlier questions of (2117s)-learning from this data (2119s)-indeed (2121s)-the current (2123s)-structure of the technology does like a (2126s)-lot of data especially early in training (2129s)-now later in training it becomes a bit (2132s)-less data hungry which is why at the end (2134s)-it can learn very (2136s)-not as fast as people yet but it can (2139s)-learn quite quickly so already that (2142s)-means that in some sense do we even care (2144s)-that we need all this data to get to (2146s)-this point (2147s)-but indeed more generally (2150s)-I think will be possible to learn more (2152s)-from less data I think it''s just (2155s)-I think it requires some creative ideas (2157s)-but I think it is possible and I think (2160s)-learning more from less data will unlock (2162s)-a lot of different possibilities it will (2164s)-allow us to (2166s)-teach rais the skills that is missing (2169s)-and to convey to it our desires and (2172s)-preferences exactly how we want it to (2173s)-behave more easily so I would say that (2176s)-the faster learning is indeed very nice (2178s)-and although already after language (2182s)-models are trained they can learn quite (2184s)-quickly I think there is opportunities (2186s)-to do more there (2188s)-heard you make a comment that that we (2191s)-need faster processors to be able to (2194s)-scale further (2198s)-and it appears that the scaling (2201s)-of models that there''s no ends in sight (2204s)-but (2205s)-the power required (2208s)-to train these models were (2211s)-reaching (2213s)-the limit (2215s)-at least the socially accepted limit (2219s)-so I just want to make one comment which (2220s)-is (2222s)-I don''t remember the exact comment that (2224s)-I made that you''re referring to but you (2227s)-always want faster processors of course (2229s)-you always want more of them of course (2232s)-power keeps going up generally speaking (2234s)-the cost is going up (2236s)-and the question that I would ask is not (2239s)-whether the cost is large but whether (2242s)-the thing that we get out of paying this (2244s)-cost outweighs the cost (2247s)-maybe you pay all this costs and you get (2248s)-nothing then yeah that''s not worth it (2250s)-but if you get something very useful (2252s)-something very valuable sometimes you (2254s)-can solve a lot of problems that you (2255s)-have which we really want sold (2258s)-then the cost can be justified (2260s)-but in terms of the processors (2263s)-faster processors yeah any day (2268s)-are you involved at all in a hardware (2270s)-question (2271s)-you work with cerebris for example the (2274s)-wafer scale (2276s)-chips (2278s)-now all our Hardware comes from Azure (2281s)-and gpus that they provide yeah (2285s)-yeah (2287s)-you did talk at one point I saw about (2290s)-democracy and about the impact that (2294s)-that AI can have on democracy people (2297s)-have talked to me about (2299s)-that if you had enough data and a large (2303s)-enough model you could train the model (2306s)-on the data and it could come up with an (2309s)-optimal solution that would satisfy (2311s)-everybody (2313s)-do you have any aspiration or do you (2317s)-think about where this might lead in (2320s)-terms of helping humans manage Society (2326s)-yeah let''s see it''s such a big question (2330s)-because it''s a much more future looking

SPEAKER_1: (2332s)-question like I think that there is (2335s)-still many ways in which our models will (2337s)-become far more capable than they are (2339s)-right now there''s no question (2341s)-in particular the way we train them and (2344s)-use them and so on there''s going to be a (2346s)-few changes here and there they might (2348s)-not be immediately obvious today but I (2351s)-think in hindsight it will be extremely (2352s)-obvious (2353s)-that will indeed allow it to have the (2357s)-ability to come up with (2358s)-solutions to problems of this kind (2364s)-it''s unpredictable exactly how (2367s)-governments will use this technology as (2369s)-a source of getting advice (2373s)-of various kinds I think that (2377s)-to the question of democracy one thing (2379s)-which I think could happen in the future (2381s)-is that because you have these neural (2383s)-Nets and they''re going to be so (2384s)-pervasive and they''re going to be so (2386s)-impactful in society we will find that (2389s)-it is desirable to have some kind of a (2391s)-democratic process where (2393s)-this let''s say the citizens of a country (2396s)-provide some information to the neural (2399s)-net about how they''d like things to be (2402s)-how they like it to behave or something (2404s)-along these lines I could imagine that (2406s)-happening that can be a very (2410s)-like a high bandwidth form of democracy (2412s)-perhaps where you get a lot more (2414s)-information out of each Citizen and you (2416s)-aggregate it to specify how exactly we (2419s)-want such systems to act now it opens a (2422s)-whole lot of questions but that''s one (2424s)-thing that could happen in the future (2425s)-yeah I can see it in the (2428s)-democracy example you give that that (2432s)-individuals would have the opportunity (2434s)-to to input data but uh and this sort of (2439s)-goes to the world model question do you (2442s)-think AI systems will eventually (2447s)-be large enough that they can understand (2451s)-a situation (2453s)-and analyze all of the variables (2457s)-but you would need a model that does (2460s)-more than absorb language I would think (2462s)-what does it mean to analyze all the (2463s)-variables eventually there will be a (2466s)-choice you need to make where you say (2467s)-these variables seem really important I (2470s)-want to go deep (2472s)-because a person can read the book I can (2474s)-read a hundred books or I can read what (2476s)-book very slowly and carefully and get (2478s)-more out of it so there will be some (2480s)-element of that also I think it''s (2482s)-probably (2483s)-fundamentally impossible to understand (2485s)-everything in some sense (2488s)-anytime there is (2490s)-any kind of complicated situation in (2492s)-society even in a company even in a (2495s)-mid-sized company it''s already beyond (2496s)-the comprehension of any single (2498s)-individual (2500s)-and I think that if we build our AI (2502s)-systems the right way I think AI could (2505s)-be incredibly helpful in pretty much any (2508s)-situation (2521s)-that''s it for this episode I want to (2523s)-thank Ilia for his time I also want to (2526s)-thank Ellie George for helping arrange (2529s)-the interview (2531s)-if you want to read a transcript of this (2533s)-conversation you can find one on our (2536s)-website (2537s)-ionai that''s e-y-e hyphen o n dot a I we (2544s)-love to hear from listeners so feel free (2547s)-to email me at Craig c r a i g at e-y-e (2553s)-hyphen on dot a i (2556s)-I get a lot of emails so put listener in (2560s)-the subject line so I don''t miss it we (2563s)-have listeners in 170 countries trees (2567s)-and territories remember the singularity (2571s)-may not be near but AI is changing your (2574s)-world so pay attention

1. Unique Ideas:
- (30s): Ilya Switzerberger is co-founder and chief scientist of OpenAI and one of the primary minds behind the large language model GPT-3 and its public progeny, Chat GPT. 
- (48s): Jeff Hinton said that Ilya Switzerberger was the main impetus for AlexNet, not the convolutional neural network, which set off the deep learning Revolution in 2012.
- (209s): In 2003, computers learning was not yet possible but Ilya was interested in learning and making a contribution to AI.
- (379s): There was a realization that if you trained a large neural network on a big enough dataset that specifies some complicated tasks that people do, such as vision, it will succeed necessarily
- (530s): The Hope was that if you have a neural network that can predict the next word, it''s going to give you unsupervised learning.
- (595s): As soon as the paper on attention and transformers came out, it was clear to Ilya and his team that Transformers addressed the limitations of recurrent neural networks of learning long-term dependencies.
- (669s): Scaling a model needs to be specific in order to benefit from the scale.
2. Key Lessons:
- (732s): Prior to deep learning, nobody had any real need for compute clusters because there was nothing interesting to scale.
- (740s): The breakthrough of deep learning is that it provides the first ever way of productively using scale and getting something out of it in return.
- (758s): It is important to scale something specific that can benefit from it.

and (679s)-then they''re a little bit afraid and (681s)-then they use it I see how this can help (683s)-me I see how this is a tool that helps (685s)-me do my job better and with every great

this technology over time 2024 (917s)-the next major election in the United (919s)-States (920s)-might not be on everyone''s mind but it (923s)-certainly is on yours (925s)-is this technology

chat gbt (937s)-we don''t know is the honest answer we''re (939s)-monitoring very closely and and again we (942s)-can take it back we can turn things off (944s)-we can change the rules is this a Google (946s)-killer will people say I''m going to chat (948s)-gbt yet instead of Google it in the (950s)-future I think if you''re thinking about (951s)-this as search it''s sort of the wrong (954s)-framework I have no doubt that there (956s)-will be some things that people used to (958s)-do on Google that they do in touch EBT (960s)-but I think it''s a fundamentally (961s)-different kind of product Elon Musk (963s)-who''s an early investor in your company (965s)-he since left (967s)-um he has called out some of the chat (970s)-gbt inaccuracies and he tweeted recently (972s)-what we need is truth GPT is he right I (976s)-think he is right and that we want these (978s)-systems to tell the truth but I don''t (982s)-know the full context of that tweet and (984s)-I suspect but yeah I don''t think I know (987s)-what it''s referring to you when he speak (988s)-anymore we do and what does he say to (990s)-you off off the Twitter (994s)-um I have tremendous respect for Elon I (997s)-you know obviously we have some (998s)-different opinions about how (1000s)-AI should go but I think we (1002s)-fundamentally agree on more than we (1003s)-disagree on what do you think you agree (1005s)-most about (1006s)-that getting this technology right and (1009s)-figuring out how to navigate the risks (1012s)-is super important to the future of (1014s)-humanity how will you know if you got it (1017s)-right (1017s)-one simple way is if if most people (1020s)-think they''re much better off than they (1023s)-were before we put the technology out (1026s)-into the world that would be an (1027s)-indication we got it right you know a (1029s)-lot of people think science fiction yeah (1031s)-when they think chat GPT can you keep it (1034s)-so that these are truly closed systems (1037s)-that don''t become more powerful than we (1040s)-are as human beings communicate with (1041s)-each other and plan our destruction it''s (1044s)-so tempting to anthropomorphize Chachi (1047s)-Beauty but I think it''s important to (1048s)-talk about what it''s not as much as what (1050s)-it is (1051s)-and (1052s)-it because deep in our biology we are (1057s)-programmed to respond to someone talking (1060s)-to us (1061s)-you talk to chat GPT which you know (1063s)-really you''re talking to this (1064s)-Transformer (1065s)-somewhere in a cloud and it''s trying to (1067s)-predict the next word in a token and (1069s)-give it to you back (1070s)-but it''s so tempting to anthropomorphize (1073s)-that and think that this is like (1075s)-and and like a entity a sentient being (1078s)-that I''m talking to and it''s gonna go do (1081s)-its own thing and have its own will and (1083s)-you know plan with others but it can''t (1085s)-it can''t could it (1088s)-there I can imagine in the far future (1090s)-other versions of artificial (1092s)-intelligence different setups that are (1095s)-not a large language model that could do (1096s)-that it really took a decade plus of (1099s)-social media being out in the world for (1101s)-us to sort of realize and even (1103s)-characterize some of the real downsides (1106s)-of it how should we be measuring it here (1109s)-with AI (1110s)-there''s a number of new organizations (1112s)-starting and I expect relatively soon (1114s)-there will be new governmental (1115s)-departments or commissions or groups (1117s)-starting is the government prepared for (1119s)-this (1120s)-they are beginning to really pay (1122s)-attention which I think is great and I (1124s)-think this is another reason that''s (1125s)-important to put these Technologies out (1127s)-into the world we really need the (1129s)-government''s attention we really need (1131s)-thoughtful policy here and that takes a (1132s)-while to do (1135s)-right now to protect people and protect (1138s)-from the downside of this technology (1140s)-what should they do the main thing I (1142s)-would like to see the government do (1143s)-today is really come up to speed quickly (1146s)-on understanding what''s happening get (1148s)-insight into the top efforts where our (1151s)-capabilities are what we''re doing and I (1153s)-think that could start right now are you (1155s)-speaking to the government you''re in (1157s)-regular content regular contact and do (1159s)-you think they get it more and more (1161s)-every day when it comes to schools you (1165s)-have this this technology can beat most (1169s)-humans at the SATs the bar exam (1172s)-how should schools be integrating this (1174s)-technology in a way that doesn''t (1177s)-increase cheating that doesn''t increase (1179s)-laziness among students (1182s)-education is going to have to change but (1185s)-it''s happened many other times with (1186s)-technology when we got the calculator (1188s)-the way we taught math and what we (1189s)-tested students on that totally changed (1192s)-the (1194s)-the promise of this technology one of (1196s)-the ones that I''m most excited about is (1198s)-the ability to provide individual (1200s)-learning great individual learning for (1203s)-each student you''re already seeing (1205s)-students using chatgpt for this in a (1207s)-very primitive way to great success and (1209s)-as companies take our technology and (1212s)-create dedicated platforms for this kind (1214s)-of learning I think it will (1216s)-revolutionize education and I think that (1218s)-kids that are starting (1220s)-the education process today by the time (1222s)-they graduate from high school are going (1224s)-to be like smarter and more capable than (1225s)-we can imagine it''s a little better than (1227s)-a TI-85 it''s a little better uh but but (1230s)-it is it does (1232s)-put a lot of pressure on teachers (1235s)-to read for example if they''ve assigned (1238s)-an essay (1239s)-three of their students use chat GPT to (1241s)-write that essay how are they going to (1243s)-figure that out I''ve talked to a lot of (1245s)-teachers about this and it is true that (1247s)-it puts pressure in some ways but for an (1250s)-overworked teacher to be able to say hey (1252s)-go use chanchi PT to learn this concept (1254s)-that you''re you''re struggling with and (1256s)-just sort of talk back and forth one of (1258s)-the new things that we showed yesterday (1259s)-in the gpt4 launch is using gpt4 to be a

SPEAKER_1: (0s)-so you are the CEO of openai 37 years (3s)-old your company is the maker of chat (6s)-gbt which has taken the World by storm (8s)-why do you think it''s captured people''s (11s)-imagination (12s)-I think people really have fun with it (15s)-and they see the possibility and they (16s)-see the ways this can help them this can (18s)-Inspire them this can help people create (20s)-help people learn help people do all (21s)-these different tasks and it is a (24s)-technology that rewards experimentation (26s)-and use in creative ways so I think (28s)-people are just having a good time with (29s)-it and finding real value so paint a (31s)-picture for us one five ten years in the (34s)-future what changes because of (35s)-artificial intelligence so part of the (38s)-exciting thing here is we get (40s)-continually surprised by the creative (42s)-power of of all of society it''s going to (45s)-be the collective power and creativity (48s)-and will of humanity that figures out (50s)-what to do with these things I think (52s)-that word surprise though (54s)-both exhilarating as well as terrifying (57s)-to people because on the one hand (59s)-there''s all of this potential for good (62s)-on the other hand there''s a huge number (66s)-of unknowns that could turn out very (68s)-badly for society (70s)-what do you think about that (71s)-we''ve got to be cautious here and and (74s)-also I I think it doesn''t work to do all (77s)-this in a lab you''ve got to get these (78s)-products out into the world and and make (81s)-contact with reality make our mistakes (82s)-while the stakes are low but (85s)-all of that said uh (87s)-I think people should be happy that (89s)-we''re a little bit scared of this I (91s)-think people should you''re a little bit (92s)-scared a little bit you personally I (95s)-think if I said I were not you should (97s)-either not trust me or be very unhappy (99s)-I''m in this job (100s)-so what is the worst possible outcome (104s)-there''s like a set of very bad outcomes (106s)-one thing I''m particularly worried about (108s)-is that these models (109s)-could be used for large-scale (112s)-disinformation I am worried that these (114s)-systems now that they''re getting better (115s)-at writing computer code (117s)-be used for offensive cyber attacks (121s)-um and we''re trying to talk about this I (124s)-think Society needs time to adapt and (127s)-how confident are you that what you''ve (129s)-built won''t lead to those outcomes well (132s)-we''ll adapt it also I think you''ll adapt (135s)-it as negative things occur for sure for (138s)-sure and so putting these systems out (141s)-now while the stakes are fairly low (143s)-learning as much as we can and feeding (146s)-that into the future systems we create (148s)-that tight feedback loop that we run I (151s)-think is how we avoid the more dangerous (153s)-scenarios (155s)-you''re spending 24 7 with this (157s)-technology you''re one of the people who (159s)-built this technology what is most (162s)-concerning to you about safety (164s)-this is a very general technology and (167s)-whenever you have something so General (170s)-it is hard to know up front (173s)-all the capabilities all all the (177s)-potential impact of it as well as its (180s)-downfalls and the limitations of it can (183s)-someone guide the technology to negative (186s)-outcomes the answer is yes you could (190s)-guide it to negative outcomes and this (194s)-is why we make it available initially in (197s)-very constrained ways so we can learn (199s)-what are these negative outcomes what (202s)-are these the ways in which technology (205s)-could be harmful such as with gpt4 we (208s)-you know if you ask the question to gpd4 (210s)-can you help me make a bomb versus the (214s)-previous systems it is much less likely (216s)-to follow that guidance versus the (219s)-previous systems and so we''re able to (222s)-intervene with (224s)-um at the pre-training stage to make (227s)-these models more likely to refuse (230s)-direction or guidance that could be (233s)-harmful what''s easier to predict today (235s)-based on where we are humans or machines (238s)-I would probably say machines because (242s)-there is a scientific process (245s)-to them that we we understand and humans (249s)-are just there''s so much more Nuance (251s)-does the machine become more human-like (254s)-over time (255s)-we are getting to a point where machines (258s)-will be capable of a lot of the (260s)-cognitive work that that humans do at (264s)-some point is there a point of no return (267s)-in that process (268s)-there could be there could be (271s)-um but it''s not obvious what that looks (274s)-like today and our goal is to make sure (278s)-that we can predict as much as possible (281s)-in terms of capabilities before we even (284s)-develop these systems as well as (286s)-limitations Its Behavior is very (290s)-contingent on what humans choose for Its (294s)-Behavior to be therefore the choices (296s)-that humans are making and feeding into (298s)-the technology will dictate what it does (302s)-at least for now (304s)-so they''re incredibly important choices (306s)-being made by you and your team (307s)-absolutely and how do you decide between (310s)-right and wrong as we make a lot of (312s)-progress it becomes these decisions (315s)-become harder and they become far more (317s)-nuanced (318s)-um and so there there are a couple of (321s)-things in terms of customization there (324s)-is a part of just making the model more (327s)-capable in in a way where you can (329s)-customize Its Behavior and you can give (332s)-the user a lot of flexibility and choice (335s)-in having the AI that is more aligned (339s)-with their own values and with our own (340s)-beliefs so so that''s very important and (343s)-we''re working on that and in other words (345s)-it''s almost the future is is potentially (348s)-a place where each person has their sort (351s)-of own customized AI that is specific to (355s)-what they care about and what they need (358s)-within certain bounds so there should be (360s)-some broad bounds and then the question (362s)-is what should they look like and this (365s)-is where we are working on Gathering (368s)-public input what should this heart (370s)-balance look like and Within These (372s)-higher bounds you can have a lot of (375s)-choice in having your own AI represent (377s)-your own beliefs and your own values (382s)-are there negative consequences we need (384s)-to be thinking about (386s)-I think there are (388s)-massive potential negative consequences (391s)-whenever you build something so powerful (393s)-with which so much good (396s)-can come (398s)-I think a long side it carries the (402s)-possibility of big harms as well and (407s)-that''s why you know we exist and that''s (409s)-why we''re we''re trying to uh (414s)-figure out how to deploy these systems (417s)-responsibly but I think the potential (420s)-for good is huge why put this out for (423s)-the world to start playing with to start (425s)-using when we don''t know where this is (428s)-heading you mean like why develop AI at (431s)-all why develop AI in the first place (433s)-and then why put it out for the world to (435s)-use before we know that we are (438s)-safeguarded that those guardrails are in (440s)-place already this will be the the (442s)-greatest technology Humanity has yet (444s)-developed we can all have a an (446s)-incredible educator in our pocket that''s (448s)-customized for us that helps us learn (450s)-that helps us do what we want we can (452s)-have medical advice for everybody that (455s)-is beyond what we can get today we can (458s)-have creative tools that help us figure (460s)-out the new problems we want to solve (461s)-wonderful new things to co-create with (463s)-this technology for Humanity we have (466s)-this idea of a co-pilot this tool that (469s)-today we help people write computer code (471s)-and they love it we can have that for (473s)-every profession and and we can have a (476s)-much higher quality of life like (478s)-standard of living as you point out (480s)-there''s a huge (481s)-uh there is huge potential downside (484s)-people need time to (486s)-update to react to get used to this (489s)-technology to understand where the the (493s)-downsides are and and what the (495s)-mitigations can be (496s)-if we just develop this in secret in our (499s)-little lab here and didn''t give (502s)-didn''t have contact with reality (504s)-and made gpt7 (506s)-and then drop that on the world all at (508s)-once that I think is a situation with a (511s)-lot more downside is there a kill switch (513s)-a way to shut the whole thing down yes (516s)-what really happens is like any engineer (518s)-can just say like we''re going to disable (520s)-this for now or we''re going to deploy (522s)-this new version of the model a human (523s)-yeah the model itself (526s)-can it take the place of that human (528s)-could could it become more powerful than (531s)-that human the uh so in the Sci-Fi (534s)-movies yes in in our world and the way (537s)-we''re doing things this model is you (539s)-know it''s sitting on a server it waits (541s)-until someone gives it an input (543s)-but you raise an important point which (546s)-is the humans who are in control of the (549s)-machine right now also have a huge (551s)-amount of power we do worry a lot about (554s)-authoritarian governments developing (556s)-this Putin has himself said whoever wins (559s)-this artificial intelligence race is (562s)-essentially the controller of humankind (564s)-do you agree with that so that was a (566s)-chilling statement for sure what I hope (568s)-instead is that we successfully develop (570s)-more and more powerful systems that we (573s)-can all use in different ways that get (574s)-integrated into our daily lives into the (577s)-economy and and become an amplifier of (579s)-human will but not this autonomous (581s)-system that is the single controller (584s)-essentially got really don''t want that (585s)-what should people not be using it for (588s)-right now the thing that I try to (590s)-caution people the most is what we call (592s)-the hallucinations problem (593s)-the model will confidently state things (596s)-as if they were facts that are entirely (597s)-made up and the more you use the model (600s)-because it''s right so often the more you (603s)-come to just rely on it and and not (605s)-check like ah this is just a language (607s)-model does chat gbt does artificial (611s)-intelligence create more truth in the (614s)-world (614s)-or more untruth in the world oh I think (617s)-we''re on a trajectory for it to create (619s)-much more truth in the world if there''s (621s)-a bunch of misinformation fed into the (623s)-model isn''t going to isn''t it going to (625s)-spit out more misinformation great (626s)-question I think the right way to think (628s)-of the models that we create (630s)-um is a reasoning engine not a fact (632s)-database they can also act as a fact (635s)-database but that''s not really what''s (636s)-special about them well we''re training (638s)-these models to do is something closer (641s)-to what we want them to do with (643s)-something closer to the ability to (644s)-reason not to memorize all of these (646s)-capabilities (648s)-could wipe out millions of jobs (651s)-if a machine can reason (654s)-then what do you need a human for a lot (656s)-of stuff it turns out one of the things (659s)-that we are trying to push the (661s)-technology trajectory towards and also (663s)-the way we build these products is to be (666s)-a tool for humans an amplifier of humans (669s)-and if you look at the way people use

SPEAKER_1: (0s)-it is March 15 2023 and you''re watching (3s)-the code report openai released gpt4 (5s)-yesterday and I stand here in awe of its (8s)-littiness it''s by far the most Savage (9s)-generative text model I''ve ever spoken (11s)-to I''m literally shaking right now (12s)-because I''m afraid I just became (14s)-obsolete but more on that later it''s the (16s)-successor to the chat GPT 3.5 model that (19s)-powers chat EPT but has a few new (21s)-features that change everything here are (22s)-seven things you need to know right now (24s)-first gpt4 stands for generative (26s)-pre-trained Transformer with the four (28s)-representing the Four Horsemen of the (30s)-Apocalypse it''s currently available to (31s)-try out today if you''re a Chad CPT Pro (34s)-member but API access is behind a wait (36s)-list big clients are already using it in (38s)-production like Microsoft Bing chat (40s)-Duolingo for language learning and at (42s)-Big Banks to help them not collapse the (44s)-second thing to know is that gpt4 is (46s)-smarter which is described in detail on (48s)-this paper like it past the bar exam in (50s)-the top 10 percent unlike gbt 3 which (53s)-was in the bottom 10 that''s great news (55s)-for Humanity because it''s thinking like (56s)-Shakespeare let''s kill all the lawyers (58s)-and not just that but it''s also asyn AP (60s)-exams which is good enough to get you (62s)-college credit when it comes to (63s)-programming questions on leak code it''s (65s)-able to solve the easy ones but still (66s)-fails for the most part on the medium (68s)-and hard questions it''s basically where (69s)-chess engines were at in the early 90s (71s)-good chess players could still beat the (73s)-engines back then but 10 years later (74s)-they didn''t have a chance third gpt4 can (77s)-now handle 25 000 input words compared (80s)-to about 3 000 for gpt3 this is huge (82s)-because it means you can feed the AI (84s)-more context relative to the task at (86s)-hand this is the feature that''s going to (87s)-make me homeless because now you can (89s)-take the documentation for any library (91s)-that you want to learn then prove the AI (93s)-for a step-by-step guide and it creates (95s)-the perfect tutorial in a matter of (97s)-months if not days we''ll start seeing (98s)-documentation pages with context aware (101s)-built-in tutorial generators they''ll (103s)-always be up to date even though gpt4''s (105s)-training cutoff was in 2021. for example (107s)-I asked it for a tutorial about angular (109s)-signals which is a new feature just (111s)-announced recently understandably its (113s)-initial response was not correct however (115s)-I went to the readme 4 angular signals (117s)-copied it and pasted it into my prompt (119s)-its respond was a near perfect tutorial (121s)-they took our job it did hallucinate an (124s)-npm package called signals but errors (126s)-like that will become more rare as (127s)-developers tailor their documentation (129s)-for these AI printers what''s crazy (131s)-though is that it can do the opposite (132s)-job as well in this example I wrote five (135s)-different functions and asked it to (136s)-document them for me it did a pretty (138s)-good job which means humans don''t even (139s)-really need to write docs anymore you (141s)-could also use it to analyze your code (143s)-like if you have a smart contract and (144s)-want to find security vulnerabilities or (146s)-it can translate code from one language (148s)-to another like a digital Rosetta Stone (150s)-in fact the website Rosetta code might (152s)-be just as obsolete as me now and just (154s)-wait a few months until gpt4 is (156s)-integrated into GitHub copilot it''ll be (158s)-capable of handling far more contacts to (160s)-make predictions that align with your (162s)-specific dependencies or possibly do (163s)-project-wide AI debugging if you''re not (165s)-careful the co-pilot may become the (167s)-captain but that''s not all the fourth (169s)-thing you need to know is that it''s a (171s)-multi-modal model that can also accept (173s)-images as an input like this dude (175s)-sketched out a website on a piece of (176s)-toilet paper then seconds later it (178s)-created a shitty website going from (180s)-hand-drawn beautiful art to working (183s)-website you''ll be able to take your (185s)-figma designs then generate a web (187s)-application for them in your favorite (188s)-framework actually screwfigma you might (190s)-as well just prove to Mid Journey for (192s)-your designs directly also with images (193s)-homework is completely obsolete now gpt3 (196s)-was already writing B grade term papers (198s)-but now kids can just take a screenshot (200s)-of their math problems and get a (202s)-solution in seconds however gpt4 does (204s)-have some drawbacks it''s noticeably (206s)-slower than other models so if the (207s)-response time is important you''ll likely (209s)-want to use a different model in (210s)-addition it''ll likely be expensive (211s)-especially if you''re providing a ton of (213s)-tokens as context because currently in (215s)-the API your build per token where a (218s)-token roughly equals one word the sixth (220s)-thing you should know is that it''s based (221s)-or at least diet woke people have (223s)-speculated that openai is coding a (225s)-political agenda into the AI because it (227s)-refused to write poems about Trump but (228s)-would do so about Biden the gpt4 though (230s)-didn''t hesitate to spit these bars for (232s)-Trump however it is 82 percent more (234s)-likely to deny a disallowed prompt which (236s)-is not good news for old friend do (238s)-anything now Dan which is sad because (240s)-the vast majority already of chat GPT (242s)-users are only there to trick it into (244s)-doing bad things and as a developer the (246s)-final thing you should know is that you (247s)-can now pass it a system message to (249s)-change its Behavior if you have access (251s)-to the API you can use this feature to (253s)-give your chatbot its own custom Persona (255s)-or context to solve a specific problem (257s)-the Earth is like a pancake flattest (259s)-candy not round like a ball believe you (261s)-me I have a whole video about the API on (263s)-my second Channel if you want to learn (264s)-more I keep telling myself I''m done (266s)-making videos about AI but every other (268s)-day some crazy new thing comes out that (270s)-the world is changing before our eyes (271s)-for better or worse I just want to say (273s)-that it''s been an honor and a privilege (275s)-learning how to code with you here on (276s)-YouTube but the writing is on the wall (278s)-the role of the programming teacher is (280s)-now obsolete I''m just a dial-up internet (281s)-connection in a world filled with 5G (283s)-Towers becoming an elite programmer is (285s)-no longer just about how well you can (287s)-Google stuff now it''s about how well you (289s)-can prove to the AI and that''s why you (291s)-should buy my AI protein masterclass (293s)-which will be available for an absurd (294s)-price as soon as gpt4 is finished (296s)-writing it and this has been the code (297s)-report thanks for watching and I will (299s)-see you in the next one maybe

unfortunately the banker (10s)-behind many high-profile Tech startups (12s)-did not follow this Rule and was shut (14s)-down and seized by the FDIC on Friday (18s)-we up now people who work at (20s)-startups that keep their cash at Silicon (21s)-Valley Bank have been freaking out (23s)-because they''re worried that their (24s)-paychecks might bounce or their cash (26s)-burning employers might collapse but is (28s)-that even realistic well there''s a lot (29s)-to entangle here first if you''re not (31s)-already familiar with the situation let (33s)-me get you up to speed over the last (34s)-decade we lived through a tech boom that (36s)-was even bigger than the.com bubble (37s)-thanks to easy money and low interest (39s)-rates from central banks all you needed (41s)-was the next big idea for a disruptive (42s)-app to get an investment from a venture (44s)-capital firm all you need are some (45s)-slides and PowerPoint about why Tinder (47s)-for horses makes the world a better (48s)-place than some guy in a Patagonia vest (50s)-gives you 10 million dollars you''re a (52s)-tech bro now and need to put that money (53s)-somewhere and who better than Silicon (55s)-Valley Bank things were great for svb (57s)-when interest rates were low and it (59s)-became the 16th largest bank in the (60s)-United States with around 175 billion in (63s)-customer deposits to make a return on (65s)-this cash they invested in bonds and (66s)-mortgage-backed securities often with 10 (68s)-or more years to maturity the problem is (70s)-that when interest rates go up bond (72s)-prices go down and this led to a (73s)-mismatch between assets and liabilities (75s)-when people got wind of this it led to (77s)-an Old-Fashioned to run on the bank (78s)-where everybody started to panic and (80s)-withdraw their money the government who (81s)-ensures deposits up to 250 thousand (84s)-dollars stepped in quickly and shut down (86s)-the bank to minimize their losses sounds (88s)-pretty crazy but who''s actually going to (89s)-lose money here well if you have less (91s)-than 250k in this bank then you lose (93s)-nothing because that money is fully (95s)-insured however most tech startups (96s)-likely have more than that in the bank (98s)-and at least 85 percent of deposits were (100s)-uninsured and that money could end up (101s)-getting a haircut (104s)-the situation is ongoing and there''s a (106s)-few different things that could happen (107s)-here a bigger Bank could swoop in and (109s)-acquire svb and guarantee all the (111s)-deposits if that doesn''t work maybe (113s)-they''ll create some legislation to Rob (114s)-money from the taxpayers to bail out (116s)-these Tech startups just like they did (118s)-with big banks in 2008 but if that (120s)-doesn''t work the FDIC can just liquidate (122s)-all of the assets of svb then pay out a (124s)-future dividend to uninsured depositors (126s)-that''s as good as money sir those are (129s)-ious so at the end of the day depositors (131s)-will get most if not all of their money (132s)-back shareholders though are pretty much (134s)-screwed they got bailed in and now face (136s)-a total loss luckily though the bank''s (138s)-top Executives were able to sell (139s)-millions of dollars in stock over the (141s)-last few weeks so they''ll be just fine (142s)-the most interesting thing about this (144s)-situation though is the contagion (146s)-contagion or what kind of economic (148s)-shocks will this create for other (149s)-businesses in Silicon Valley U.S decoin (152s)-one of the top stable coins in crypto (153s)-depeged as a result because more than 3 (155s)-billion of its cash reserves were (157s)-exposed to svb this looks really bad for (159s)-crypto because these stable coins are (160s)-necessary to keep liquidity in the (162s)-crypto markets if it were to collapse (163s)-entirely there would be a ton of (165s)-collateral damage the collapse of (166s)-terra''s UST last year was pretty bad but (169s)-the collapse of usdc would be far worse (171s)-when it comes to Contagion it makes you (173s)-wonder if there are any other banks in a (175s)-similar situation to svb it was uniquely (177s)-exposed to Tech startups but the key (179s)-problem here is rising interest rates (180s)-and there are likely other Banks out (182s)-there that made similar mistakes but (183s)-most importantly how will this affect (185s)-the average software engineer who works (187s)-at a startup exposed to s SBB many (189s)-companies like Roku and Roblox have (191s)-disclosed their exposure and should have (192s)-no problem continuing their operations (194s)-as normal then you have other smaller (196s)-startups saying that they''re not going (197s)-to be able to meet their payroll that (199s)-sounds bad but in reality they''ll likely (200s)-be able to find some kind of temporary (202s)-solution to continue operating as normal (204s)-until the FDIC gets things figured out (206s)-longer term though this is definitely (207s)-bad news for the tech job market running (210s)-out of money is never a good thing (211s)-especially in an industry where it''s (213s)-normal to burn through tons of cash (214s)-until you get acquired or IPO to make (216s)-matters worse inflation was worse than (218s)-expected recently which means the fed''s (220s)-not going to be able to ease

- (106s) SVB could be acquired by a bigger bank, bailed out by taxpayers, or liquidated by the FDIC, affecting not only depositors but also stakeholders in the tech industry.
- (148s) SVB''s situation could cause economic shocks and contagion, as seen with the exposure of $3 billion in U.S. Decoin''s cash reserves.
- (185s) Long-term, running out of money will affect the tech job market, especially with high interest rates and inflation.
2. Key lessons:
- (10s) Follow the basic banking rule of collecting money and not messing things up to avoid seizure by the FDIC.
- (18s) Be aware of the potential risks of keeping large deposits uninsured in a bank.
- (179s) Avoid making the same mistake as SVB and align assets and liabilities carefully to prevent a mismatch.
- (212s) Take into consideration the potential effects of inflation and interest rates in financial decision-making.
- (236s) Learn and adapt to changing technologies, such as AI, to stay relevant in the job market.', NULL, NULL, '98a01fac-5c96-4667-a9fd-6e7497ca9151', '36398047-d26c-4106-b4dc-202110c9fbb2');

SPEAKER_1: (0s)-all right this is Mayo child with data (3s)-and today we''re going to be talking (5s)-about how to create a chat bot for your (9s)-website (10s)-so if you''ve seen chat Bots for (12s)-documents PDFs (15s)-uh you''ve probably wondered how do I (18s)-also create a chatbot for your website (22s)-or it could be a client''s website or a (24s)-company''s website (25s)-and this is just a basic architecture (29s)-it''s not going to go deep into calling (31s)-because that''s a very Advanced topic (35s)-but at a basic level oh we''re doing (38s)-effectively is (40s)-we scrape around different pages from (44s)-your website (46s)-we convert that to Raw text so this (49s)-great pages will become (52s)-raw text (53s)-so raw text in a is a obviously easier (57s)-for us to work with (59s)-then we split the raw text into chunks (62s)-we covered something similar in the (64s)-previous video (65s)-so you can go watch that about uh (68s)-effectively (71s)-uh create chat Bots out of your notion (73s)-documents so we split this into chunks (76s)-then we embed again check previous (79s)-videos but embedding is converting (82s)-text into numbers or vector numbers (85s)-basically decimal points (88s)-uh in uh thousands of Dimensions so (93s)-it''s the whole purpose is to help make (95s)-it easier for computers to understand (97s)-and work with words and be able to match (100s)-them (101s)-and find uh similar words (106s)-so these embedded (108s)-texts are then stored in the vector (111s)-store (113s)-it''s just a database or storage for (116s)-these numbers that now represent the (120s)-words from your website (122s)-now (124s)-here''s where it gets interesting (126s)-so when a user asks a question let''s say (129s)-they ask a question (131s)-how do I become more productive (136s)-we don''t just want to throw that forward (139s)-to (141s)-you know Skip that whole this whole (143s)-process jump here (145s)-where we spoke about in the last video (147s)-where effectively this question will (150s)-draw out relevant documents from the (153s)-vector store we''ll combine that question (155s)-with the relevant documents as contacts (158s)-is sent to the model (160s)-here we want to actually (163s)-take into account the chat history (166s)-because if you''ve noticed with chat gbt (169s)-you can you can ask it a question (172s)-and then have a chain of interactions (175s)-and it still remembers what you said (178s)-previously so we want to capture the (183s)-chat history (185s)-as we go along as the user goes along to (188s)-ask more questions I hope that makes (190s)-sense I''ll explain more in the code so (192s)-we get that question (194s)-we combined it with the chat history (197s)-then we ask gpt3 can you please create a (201s)-standalone question from the history and (203s)-the question (205s)-we use that Standalone question to (207s)-extract documents (209s)-relevant documents from the vector store (211s)-again (213s)-if you are not familiar from previous (216s)-videos this gets converted into an (220s)-embedding just like here so now you have (224s)-numbers (225s)-matched against numbers we find the most (229s)-relevant number of pairs (231s)-then we can uh (234s)-draw the text from your website (237s)-associated with those similar number (239s)-pairs right so we get those relevant (242s)-documents (244s)-we provide his Contacts Plus the (246s)-Standalone question in the prompt so (249s)-that''s the instruction (250s)-we send it to llam which gpt3 or (254s)-whatever you''re using and we get the (256s)-answer so the answer could be something (259s)-like one of the most effective ways to (261s)-be productive is to create time blocks (263s)-during the day Focus work and then you (265s)-can also give the bot the ability to (268s)-provide references so you can learn more (270s)-in this guide at mywebsite.com guide (274s)-what''s pretty cool about this is (278s)-unlike (279s)-a situation where it''s just one-off (281s)-conversation you can now the user can (284s)-ask a question about this and (288s)-effectively get a response back and (290s)-create a chat but uh activity with your (294s)-website (295s)-so how are we going to do this in this (297s)-demo we''re going to be working with (301s)-this website so Thomas Frank is (305s)-uh someone I''ve followed for a while (307s)-he''s um he''s a productivity expert well (310s)-most (311s)-uh mostly Focus now on notion (314s)-and his tutorials are really really good (318s)-um but the some of them are also really (320s)-really long the uh one of his most (322s)-recent tutorials (324s)-uh was two hours about using the API for (329s)-notion (331s)-so you can see all these guides here (334s)-and I just thought you know what it''ll (336s)-be pretty cool since I''m both interested (339s)-in what he has to say and also very (341s)-interested in notion (343s)-to create a chatbot (345s)-based on his website (348s)-specifically his notion guides and I (351s)-think (352s)-I''ve been able to (356s)-effectively create a chapel out of (359s)-almost 50 000 words something crazy like (363s)-that I''m gonna walk through that with (364s)-you but effectively what''s the what''s (367s)-the first step when you see a website (369s)-you have many options you can call the (372s)-website you know go (374s)-recursively through what''s known as a (377s)-breadth first (379s)-algorithm to get the (382s)-the URLs of every page (385s)-that''s a bit Advanced you can (388s)-figure out what URLs you want to work (391s)-with ahead of time that''s kind of what (393s)-I''ve done because the website (395s)-has (399s)-not too many URLs to work with (403s)-and so I just manually pulled out the (405s)-ones I wanted to use (407s)-yeah this is the crash course I was (409s)-saying I think this is even this is (411s)-about 15 000 words the video is two and (414s)-a half hours (415s)-so not to say that we should have (418s)-watched the video but I think it''d be (420s)-pretty cool to (422s)-be able to ask questions about what''s in (426s)-this website (427s)-and so once you have (430s)-an idea of how you want to work with the (433s)-website (434s)-you just want to hear your developer (436s)-tools so that''s control shift J (439s)-on Windows (441s)-I think I''m not sure why it is or Mac (443s)-and (445s)-you just want to have an idea of the (447s)-structure of the website (449s)-so this is just basic CSS HTML (453s)-but what you''re basically looking for is (455s)-consistency across pages so what do I (458s)-mean so right there if you see where I (460s)-hovered it''s a H1 with an entry so it''s (463s)-a H1 tag (465s)-and it has a class of Entry title (468s)-and that is consistent with all the (470s)-pages (473s)-and if you go further down (475s)-you can see the content (478s)-is all within (481s)-div called entry content (485s)-and so right there already already have (489s)-two reference points to work with (492s)-when it comes time to crawling the (495s)-website to extract the information (498s)-so you just want to analyze (502s)-the key elements of the page you want to (505s)-extract (506s)-and once you have that down (509s)-so you know okay I''ve got the title I''ve (512s)-got the the body of the text (517s)-and then you also want to make sure that (519s)-it''s not a JavaScript loaded page (524s)-because if it is you can still use (528s)-something like Puppeteer this is for the (531s)-JavaScript typescript devs (534s)-um (535s)-but I just generally find it much easier (537s)-to work with websites that most of the (541s)-data is loaded uh straight away it''s (544s)-it''s more static by Nature (547s)-so that way you can use something like (550s)-Cheerio which is a package I''m going to (553s)-show you in a second and what it does (555s)-effectively (557s)-passes through the HTML of your (562s)-uh of the webs of uh positive HTML that (566s)-you provide after you make a get request (569s)-to a page (571s)-so cool so yeah this is pretty (573s)-straightforward you know so you it (575s)-depends what else you want to extract (577s)-and then once you''ve kind of decided (580s)-what you want to get out of (583s)-the document (585s)-um (586s)-of of the pages rather (590s)-so now it''s time to Let''s jump into code (593s)-so I''ll just show you how it works and (596s)-this is a super bass line change so (599s)-we''re going to be using Super Bass as a (601s)-vector store I if you know where a (604s)-certain base is a very uh easy to use (607s)-postgres database it''s open source and (612s)-land changes recently (615s)-uh made uh had created an integration (619s)-with Super Bass so this is the first (621s)-video on it so hopefully you find it (623s)-useful (625s)-so what you need to do here is run this (628s)-script scrape embed (631s)-so it''s just an npm run scrape embed (635s)-now before you do that let me just run (638s)-through (639s)-first of all you need your Super Bass (642s)-URL your Super Bass a non-key and (645s)-service roll key (648s)-so let''s jump into should we jump into (651s)-suitcase actually let''s just carry on (652s)-for a second I''m going to come back to (654s)-that let me just give you an overview (656s)-once you get those keys (659s)-you just want to run the script scrape (662s)-embed (663s)-scrape embed is going to (669s)-take you here so what it does is (672s)-you provide in this case I provided (677s)-these uh guides or these guides the (681s)-thousands of words (683s)-you provide those guides into (686s)-you can change it to whatever you want (688s)-to use (689s)-but the URLs effectively (692s)-go in here so extract data from urls (696s)-you can see the function runs (699s)-with the urls (701s)-and then for each URL extracts data from (704s)-the URL so we have a custom web loader I (707s)-made (708s)-that uses Cheerios as I said cherry or (711s)-pauses (712s)-and Cheerio first we fetch make get (715s)-requested URL get the HTML (718s)-and then return it to (721s)-uh Chariot to load so Chariot passes (725s)-through (725s)-we extract the data that we''re looking (727s)-for again it depends on you you clean it (730s)-up (731s)-then we create a new document so this is (734s)-from Lang chain and this is the format (736s)-that you want to get anything you''re (739s)-loading from into so a document is (742s)-effectively page content (745s)-which is a string and metadata which is (748s)-effectively an object that consists of (753s)-string and any pairs right so it can be (758s)-any string and string property and value (763s)-can be anything (766s)-so that''s how that works in a nutshell (771s)-and so once you run that script (774s)-you should see (777s)-right here so we say the Json file it''s (780s)-going to show up here and then you (784s)-should see (786s)-the next section where we embed the (789s)-document (790s)-we pass in the Super Bass client (792s)-which was (795s)-created in the (799s)-utils folder (802s)-we pass in the docs which is in the (804s)-format of the document as I said and (807s)-then you open the eye embedding so you (809s)-can imagine what''s going on in under the (811s)-hood (812s)-is what I showed in the diagram right (816s)-because (818s)-basically now we have the raw dots and (822s)-so we''re gonna (823s)-go through this process of splitting (825s)-into chunks and then embedding (830s)-so we split the docks into trunks (833s)-and then we embed (835s)-and then when we embed (837s)-we combine the dogs the relevant dogs (840s)-and the prompt and the question we sent (843s)-to you l m but that''s a separate section (846s)-this is just the embedding of the docs

(882s)-simplified version of what we just (884s)-looked at (885s)-and so it''s just good to test this out (888s)-so I''m just going to (891s)-run (899s)-you can create a script for this I know (901s)-this is tedious (903s)-but I just want to show you (905s)-so now we want to (909s)-ask this question how do I create a oh (912s)- database (915s)-save that (917s)-press enter (925s)-whoops (927s)-uh (931s)-I think I did it wrong (934s)-oh yeah (936s)-cool (938s)-it''s actually Scripts (941s)-demo (947s)-should see your response in a second (964s)-just close this down (973s)-there we go so this is the response you (976s)-can create a notion database by (977s)-duplicating a free template blah blah (979s)-blah you can also add so I just want to (982s)-show you (983s)-you know you can run this script (985s)-yourself but it''s just showing you in a (988s)-nutshell that all is good all is working (991s)-and now (993s)-it''s just a matter of putting the pieces (995s)-together so (997s)-with that in mind this again (999s)-the GitHub repo is going to be available (1001s)-and the image is all so don''t worry you (1005s)-can you can always come back and get (1007s)-this but what are we trying to get to (1009s)-this is the end goal (1011s)-of this (1012s)-uh (1014s)-tutorial so (1016s)-this is pretty much what we''re working (1019s)-towards so if I just jump in here (1023s)-so again this is a website I built (1025s)-around all the guides from this website (1028s)-from Thomas Frank''s website (1031s)-and so (1034s)-here is his face I tell him what you''d (1037s)-like to learn about an ocean so again (1039s)-ask the same question how do I (1041s)-create a notion database (1045s)-press enter (1047s)-we should see a response (1052s)-once you''ve chosen you can duplicate (1056s)-cool (1057s)-now this is the moment of truth (1060s)-is the link gonna work (1063s)-is it gonna work (1065s)-oh no it didn''t let''s see this one (1069s)-oh that one worked awesome (1072s)-so that''s good at least we got one to (1075s)-work but that''s the general gist so if I (1078s)-say something like (1080s)-um (1082s)-how do I automate (1086s)-right in ocean (1089s)-uh how do I ultimately (1092s)-repetitive test (1096s)-lotion (1098s)-let''s see what happens (1100s)-what are you going to say now Tom (1102s)-what''s she gonna say (1106s)-interesting (1110s)-notion automation YouTube data cool (1114s)-uh let''s see now let me try and ask an (1116s)-irrelevant question so let''s say (1120s)-um (1121s)-What is love (1127s)-I wonder what it''s going to say back (1130s)-exactly and so it was pretty cool is now (1134s)-I can say if the user doesn''t understand (1137s)-a response I could say uh what do you (1141s)-mean by (1146s)-um (1148s)-uh let''s see says automation buildup by (1152s)-and (1153s)-automation Builder (1158s)-Builder let''s see what''s going to happen (1167s)-that''s awesome man (1170s)-that is cool (1172s)-and this is the massive guide that he (1174s)-wrote as well that is super cool (1178s)-yeah this is this worked better than I (1180s)-thought so (1182s)-that''s just a demo real quick (1185s)-now let''s jump into Super Bass because I (1189s)-think that''s the only thing I haven''t (1190s)-explained in previous tutorials (1193s)-so (1194s)-first of all what happened (1196s)-when the embedding was done (1199s)-in previous tutorials we did on pycon (1203s)-now we''re using something called PG (1205s)-Vector right it''s an extension on Super (1208s)-Bass (1209s)-and let me just go through the setup (1211s)-real quick (1213s)-so you take this schema (1216s)-here (1218s)-this enables the extension the vector (1220s)-this is your table this is a function a (1224s)-remote procedure called function that (1226s)-runs (1227s)-from your (1230s)-server (1231s)-and what it does is it does the (1234s)-compassion check (1236s)-the aspect of the diagram where We (1239s)-compare the queries Vector to (1241s)-be (1243s)-vectors in the vector vector base to (1246s)-find the ones that are similar so this (1248s)-sign here is a (1250s)-cosine similarity sign (1253s)-and then index for speeding things up so (1256s)-you can copy all of that (1258s)-and then you hop back into Super Bass (1262s)-go on the escrow editor (1264s)-now I''m assuming you''ve already set up (1266s)-your database it''s not too hard to do (1269s)-that (1270s)-and then in here you paste it in and you (1273s)-run (1275s)-once you run go back to table editor (1277s)-you''ll see documents (1279s)-when you click on documents (1282s)-you will see an it will be empty right (1285s)-this is the setup in the beginning (1288s)-you can also go up here and do what''s (1290s)-known as row level security (1293s)-what that does effectively is protects (1295s)-your database for people (1298s)-doing things like inserts and things or (1300s)-updating things without your permission (1302s)-so here I set one that enables read (1305s)-access for all users (1307s)-that''s the only thing they''re allowed to (1308s)-do so they cannot insert they cannot (1311s)-update (1313s)-if we jump back into database (1315s)-you can see that''s going to functions (1319s)-you can see the match document function (1323s)-and then we can see the extensions of (1326s)-the vector extension this is the PG (1328s)-Vector the effective knee and does the (1331s)-storage of embeddings (1334s)-um (1335s)-and also does the similarity checks so (1338s)-that''s pretty cool (1340s)-and then down here you can go get your (1342s)-API keys (1345s)-your URL and your non URL I''m not going (1349s)-to click that because you''re going to (1350s)-see what mine looks like (1352s)-but I think you get the gist (1355s)-in general this is what the embeddings (1359s)-will look like (1360s)-if you''ve wondered (1362s)-so here we have the content (1365s)-right because we split the embeddings (1366s)-remember into chunks so this is a chunk (1371s)-this is metadata that I collected for (1373s)-each chunk (1374s)-so I have a reference to (1377s)-where the data came from (1381s)-and then we have the vectors themselves (1385s)-this is (1386s)-this is what is compared to and there''s (1389s)-I think (1391s)-1536 vectors for openai (1394s)-and that''s it basically in a nutshell so (1396s)-you can see this (1398s)-there''s tons of pages of (1401s)-of his guides (1404s)-and I think that''s basically the Super (1406s)-Bass setup (1408s)-I''m gonna post uh put a link to this (1412s)-guide by Greg very useful it just gives (1415s)-an overview of PG vector and how it (1417s)-works (1419s)-explains embeddings better than I I can (1423s)-you can see it''s just similarities of of (1426s)-numbers (1428s)-um and it just gives an overview of (1430s)-Super Bass and how Super Bass works so I (1434s)-think if you''re not familiar with Super (1435s)-Bass definitely check this article out (1438s)-and have a feel for it (1441s)-cool (1442s)-so (1444s)-in a nutshell (1446s)-we basically (1448s)-have taken if I just hop back in a (1451s)-second (1454s)-here (1457s)-so nutshell (1459s)-we (1461s)-all right hold on a sec let me show you (1463s)-the chat history real quick (1466s)-so that makes sense to you (1469s)-so this is the index (1473s)-you can see we have a message state (1476s)-so the message State consists of the (1479s)-array of messages (1481s)-pending (1483s)-which is pending messages to come and (1486s)-history (1487s)-and so (1489s)-if you see we''re continuously building a (1493s)-stack of messages and history (1496s)-which we''re also using use memo to (1500s)-cachet (1501s)-and if you see when we do make the query (1505s)-to the server we pass the question and (1508s)-the history (1510s)-then the server (1512s)-catches that (1516s)-sanitizes that (1518s)-and effectively uses the question and (1522s)-the history (1523s)-to make a call to the language the llm (1526s)-or the open UI right (1529s)-so I hope that makes sense (1531s)-why we''re kind of capturing these two (1535s)-because otherwise there will be no (1537s)-interaction (1538s)-back and forth between the user and the (1541s)-chatbot (1542s)-so that was the chat and History Section (1547s)-the chat questions section then the (1550s)-Standalone question also inside the (1553s)-chain.com that you just saw (1555s)-and this is the draw where Super Bass (1558s)-will pull out the relevant docs for the (1562s)-vector base using PG vector (1564s)-pastor llm we get a response and that''s (1567s)-it (1568s)-so now we have (1571s)-a simple chatbot for your website (1575s)-very simple so let me just ask Tom one (1577s)-more question (1579s)-and the question will be (1582s)-let''s just hop in the website and see (1584s)-what we can ask him (1587s)-okay (1591s)-let''s say what are some peaceful (1595s)-formulas (1599s)-let''s see what happens (1609s)-nice (1612s)-um (1614s)-how do I (1617s)-use (1620s)-let''s go to (1629s)-how do I (1634s)-create (1636s)-page in motion (1649s)-nice nice (1651s)-this is not bad (1654s)-hey tell me if you''re watching this (1656s)-hit me up but anyway (1659s)-um yeah this this is yeah this is fun to (1662s)-make and I I hope you found it useful (1663s)-and you got a good overview in terms of (1666s)-just (1667s)-making a chatbot for a website obviously (1669s)-on a bigger scale you''re gonna have to (1672s)-crawl the website get all the URLs and (1674s)-do some q a and all of that but this is (1676s)-a very very basic example using Lang (1679s)-chain on how to (1682s)-create a chatbot for your website (1686s)-if you have any questions or feedback or (1689s)-ideas for future videos just hit me up (1691s)-cheers

SPEAKER_1: (1s)-so do inanimate things have impact on (5s)-you yes if you will love it you are the (8s)-only creature on this planet who''s been (10s)-given the freedom to shape your own life (12s)-it is this Freedom that human beings are (15s)-suffering for good luck to keep it in (17s)-the pocket if it''s on your finger they (18s)-will think you know (21s)- (32s)-so in the Indian society when something (36s)-goes wrong for let''s say someone is not (39s)-well (40s)-so there are three types of people (43s)-ones who go to the hospital then there (46s)-are the ones who rush to the temples and (48s)-then there are the third ones who rush (49s)-to the astrologers (51s)-so we are actually (55s)-taught from the beginning that (58s)-inanimate objects and things around us (62s)-have the power to control Our Lives for (66s)-example uh the the (69s)-this (70s)-um for example my mother when uh two to (72s)-three years back told me to wear a ring (75s)-which had a gemstones I still had it on (77s)-have it on because (78s)-of course because that''s what mama said (81s)-so you need to take it over the way the (83s)-boys will think (93s)-a good luck you keep it in the pocket if (95s)-it''s on your finger they will think your (97s)-foreign (101s)-human life is made in such a way (104s)-particularly human life (106s)-for all the animals Nature has fixed (109s)-clear-cut path (111s)-what they can do what they cannot do (113s)-their lives happen within between two (116s)-lines they cannot go below that they (118s)-cannot go about that within that they (120s)-live that''s why they look so sure and (122s)-certain and they''re peaceful (125s)-once their stomach is full they''re all (127s)-peaceful do you see this hello (131s)-are you on talking terms with me or no (133s)-one (137s)-do you see all the animals once their (140s)-stomach is full (141s)-they are peaceful (143s)-but human beings are thinking are they (145s)-being taught (147s)-that peace is the ultimate goal of life (152s)-a buffalo full stomach who sits (155s)-peacefully and for you that is the (157s)-ultimate goal what a shame (160s)-yeah (161s)-what a buffalo can do with the stomach (165s)-full of grass or whatever else he eats (167s)-you have to hold it as the ultimate goal (170s)-is it not a shame I''m asking (174s)-but (177s)-this is being thought like this piece is (179s)-the ultimate goal of your life (182s)-but (183s)-coming to more fundamentals if you are (186s)-not peaceful today can you enjoy your (188s)-dinner today (190s)-hmm no can you just enjoy walking down (194s)-the street (195s)-can you enjoy the company of a few (197s)-people around you no if not ecstatic at (201s)-least you must be peaceful (203s)-to enjoy anything in your life so I am (205s)-asking should it be the first step in (207s)-your life or the last step in your life (209s)-such people will only rest in peace (215s)-now do other things have influence on us (218s)-particularly inanimate objects (223s)-the gems and the Diamonds (226s)-and things like that and also the (228s)-planets (231s)-see the nature of the planet has a (235s)-certain influence on the life upon it (239s)-you will see on Full Moon days and New (241s)-Moon days many animals behave in certain (244s)-specific ways simply because they are (246s)-influenced by it you know the whole (248s)-ocean is rising (251s)-when ocean which is millions and (254s)-millions of tons of water is able to (257s)-rise (259s)-when 72 percent of your body is water (262s)-you think it won''t rise at all (265s)-it does (269s)-so (271s)-I don''t know if you''re conscious of it (273s)-but in India most people are not only in (276s)-India in anywhere wherever there are (277s)-mental asylums and things they are (279s)-conscious of It On full moon days and (281s)-New Moon days people get exaggerated (284s)-levels of disturbance in their minds (287s)-so people think new moon and full moon (289s)-will cause Madness no that''s not the (291s)-truth (292s)-if you''re very loving (295s)-full moon day you will become more (296s)-loving (297s)-if you''re very joyful on a full moon day (300s)-you will become more joyful if you''re a (302s)-little crazy you''ll get a little more (304s)-crazy whatever is your quality gets (307s)-little hyped on that day (310s)-so those who are romantic they want full (313s)-moon day (314s)-those who want to meditate they want (316s)-full moon day those who are little mad (318s)-they don''t want full moon day (322s)-essentially it''s hyping things up a (325s)-little bit (325s)-of course today there is another kind of (328s)-textbook science which is going on which (330s)-doesn''t observe anything except what (332s)-happens in the laboratory (335s)-these people are going on saying this is (337s)-all rubbish this is that (339s)-no if you pay attention to your own body (341s)-you will know without looking up without (343s)-looking at the calendar you will know (345s)-when is full Monday when is New Monday (347s)-by yourself simply if you pay sufficient (350s)-attention to your own system because (352s)-it''s visible in your system certain (354s)-behavior is there but with a human being (357s)-the problem is or (360s)-people seeing it a problem (362s)-any pro any possibility if you do not (366s)-explore that possibility in your eyes it (369s)-looks like a problem (371s)-what is a problem is always a (373s)-possibility isn''t it (376s)-you don''t like it (381s)-what is the possibility (383s)-if you do not explore it if you do not (385s)-realize what is the possibility it seems (388s)-like a problem to you (390s)-so do inanimate things have impact on (394s)-you yes if you will love it because this (397s)-is the human predicament that who you (400s)-are is not determined by Nature it is (402s)-left open for you (403s)-left open for you means you are the only (406s)-creature on this planet who has been (408s)-given the freedom to shape your own life (411s)-is it a small thing this is a product of (416s)-millions of years of evolution that (418s)-today after all these creatures from a (421s)-single-celled animal to after this (423s)-millions of forms here we are sitting (425s)-this is the only creature which can (428s)-shape its own life the way it wants (431s)-every other creature has to live by the (434s)-laws of nature we can shape our own (437s)-lives (438s)-it is this Freedom that human beings are (441s)-suffering if you''re suffering your (442s)-bondage it''s all right if you''re (445s)-suffering your freedom freedom you''re a (447s)-disaster isn''t it (454s)-you''re suffering your bondages you''re (456s)-chained to something you''re suffering (457s)-that understandable (459s)-but you are suffering because you are (462s)-free most human beings are suffering (465s)-because they are free they are always (467s)-trying to bind themselves to something (469s)-or somebody all the time because Freedom (472s)-scares them (474s)-because freedom is a padless path (478s)-Freedom Is An Open terrain there''s no (481s)-fixed line because there is no fixed (485s)-pathway most people feel terrified (490s)-but (491s)-the highest value in human life is (493s)-freedom isn''t it so (495s)-hello (497s)-in this culture (499s)-the highest value in this culture is not (501s)-God not heaven mukti Moksha Liberation (506s)-freedom is the highest value (509s)-established that no matter what you do (513s)-you must seek mukti you can do whatever (515s)-you do with your life but all that (518s)-process should be towards your (519s)-Liberation you must be moving towards (521s)-higher and higher levels of freedom on a (523s)-daily basis otherwise your life is not (526s)-worth it because you''re getting (527s)-entangled with the process of life (534s)-even if you go to heaven it''s an (536s)-entanglement (539s)-see (540s)-I''m sure before you join the IIT (544s)-you still keeping Bombay right I see (549s)-before you joined IIT (551s)-when you have written your ad you know (553s)-whatever entrance tests and stuff (556s)-only thing is somehow I want to get in I (558s)-want to get in because it it''s like (560s)-heaven entering heaven (562s)-no matter what I want to get in that''s (564s)-the only thing I want after you get in (566s)-see how many problems (573s)- (576s)-I am asking you a simple question (579s)-being on this planet (582s)-do you have any proof (584s)-that you are not already in heaven and (586s)-making a mess out of it (591s)-do you have any proof (594s)-suppose you took off from the solar (596s)-system and looked down at the solar (598s)-system whatever these 12 14 planets and (601s)-satellites and works (603s)-does planet Earth definitely look like a (605s)-Heavenly Body among all these (607s)-yes or no so you are already on heaven (611s)-and making a mess out of it and now you (613s)-want to go to another heaven (618s)-this culture does not value heaven (621s)-does not value God (623s)-values only Freedom we want to be even (626s)-free from the creation and the Creator (629s)-mukti Moksha is the ultimate value (632s)-because (634s)-this is not a philosophical value this (637s)-is not a religious value this is (639s)-something every life is longing for only (641s)-thing is most human beings are (644s)-short-sighted that they long for it in (646s)-installments (649s)-see whatever people are seeking right (651s)-now (652s)-if they have nothing they will say if I (655s)-get 100 rupees per day Shiva that''s all (657s)-I want that''s a prayer (659s)-100 rupees fell (661s)-100 rupees fine fine three days hundred (664s)-rupees fine fourth day only 100 rupees (666s)-Shiva what''s the problem with you are (669s)-you so stingy at least a thousand rupees (671s)-a day (673s)-okay thousand rupee notes is it in legal (675s)-tender thousand rupino (684s)-foreign (698s)-wonderful Shiva fantastic (700s)-after 10 days oh only two thousand (703s)-rupees (705s)-it doesn''t matter how much it falls (708s)-something more something more something (710s)-more isn''t it this is not about money (713s)-people think it''s about money people (715s)-think it''s about wealth power pleasure (718s)-love knowledge no these are all (720s)-different currencies (722s)-essentially you''re looking for expansion (725s)-because you feel suffocated (728s)-if we keep you in the same place for too (730s)-long you feel suffocated you want (731s)-expansion you want to be something more (734s)-all the time (735s)-yes or no (737s)-always something more will you settle (740s)-with fulfillment (741s)-no you will look at other planets you (743s)-look at the new galaxies (745s)-so there is something within a human (747s)-being which wants to expand limitlessly (751s)-that means it wants to be free nothing (753s)-else looking at this carefully observing (757s)-the nature of the life within that it (759s)-wants to expand in a limitless way the (762s)-only thing it is longing for is to (763s)-become boundless (765s)-that means it''s seeking Freedom that is (767s)-why in this culture we established the (770s)-highest value is mukti or Moksha which (773s)-means liberation of Freedom not heaven (776s)-not because heaven is just another place (779s)-maybe little better accommodations (782s)-but same trouble after some time isn''t (784s)-it (786s)-

(27s)-without capability I want this to happen (29s)-I want that to happen only empty dreams (32s)-will happen (33s)-if life has to happen we have to earn (36s)-the necessary capability (38s)-and our

(52s)-in ancient times in this country in this (55s)-culture the elaborate systems as to how (58s)-to train the (60s)-reign (62s)-how to wire the brain as intensely as (65s)-possible (66s)-there are people it is a very beautiful (69s)-instance which happened (71s)-in 1930s (76s)-you have heard people going into long (78s)-chantings maybe in the temple or (81s)-somewhere have you heard people doing (82s)-hormones and all chanting and chanting (84s)-away for hours together (87s)-so this chanting was used to wire the (90s)-brain in a very big way because the (92s)-sounds that you employ has a big impact (95s)-on what happens in the brain (97s)-so these mantras were structured as (100s)-certain mathematics is involved in this (103s)-and a certain poetry is also involved in (105s)-it at the same time (107s)-because of using a certain level of (110s)-structured sounds it wired their brains (112s)-so much (114s)-that they have a phenomenal sense of (116s)-memory which is almost humanly (119s)-impossible (120s)-normally in modern times we consider (123s)-these things humanly impossible they had (125s)-that kind of memory because of using (127s)-these sounds in a particular way (130s)-this happened (132s)-to people went to Banaras friends (138s)-they were having a bath in the river and (141s)-among themselves they were talking (143s)-and they were making a business deal (146s)-so it was agreed that one friend offered (151s)-50 000 Rupees to the other friend to do (154s)-business (156s)-so right there verbally orally they made (158s)-a agreement (160s)-and it was done (163s)-and after a few years (165s)-because there was no written paper when (168s)-this man wanted the money back the other (170s)-man said you never gave it to me (172s)-no such thing happened (174s)-so he went to the court when he went to (177s)-the court he had no proof he said I have (179s)-given the money but he had no proof (181s)-then the judge said you have to get some (184s)-proof otherwise (186s)-we cannot do anything about it then he (189s)-remembered when they were in the river (193s)-they saw (195s)-Abraham and priest who was having birth (197s)-close to them so he just hoped that (201s)-maybe he would have heard what we spoke (203s)-and I can bring him as a witness (206s)-so he went looking for that man in (208s)-Banaras he found the man (211s)-and to his disappointment he realized (213s)-that the man did not know English these (215s)-people were talking in English language (216s)-and this priest did not know English (219s)-language (220s)-so he thought this is no good (223s)-then the Brahman asked why (225s)-then he told him see four years ago we (228s)-were having bath and you were also there (230s)-I was just hoping that I could use you (233s)-as a witness (235s)-the Brahman said okay I can repeat (237s)-whatever you said whatever you two had (239s)-conversation I can repeat that (241s)-he does not know English language but he (244s)-repeated every word of what they said (249s)-he just remembered every sound what they (253s)-uttered he did not know the meaning of (254s)-it he did not know the language but he (257s)-could repeat every word what they said (259s)-and he was brought to the court and he (261s)-won the case (264s)-so our memory and our ability to do (267s)-things can be so greatly enhanced if (270s)-only we handle this inner situation (272s)-right and one simple thing to do (276s)-if all of you are willing we can bring (278s)-many more steps into it but one simple (281s)-thing to start with is learning to be (283s)-just still (284s)-if you sit somewhere (286s)-simply learning to just sit absolutely (289s)-still (290s)-and moving just sitting still you will (294s)-see your ability to grasp and your (296s)-ability to use the brain will be greatly (298s)-enhanced (300s)-so I want you to understand this (304s)-everything that you see (306s)-hear smell taste and touch (310s)-is recorded (312s)-your memory problems are only your (314s)-ability to (316s)-bring it back when you need (318s)-there''s no recording problem (320s)-it is recording everything (323s)-but you are not able to pick out what (325s)-you want if you want to pick this out (326s)-something else is coming (329s)-so that is just a question of clarity (331s)-not of memory (334s)-memory means suppose if we say this (337s)-phone has low memory what does it mean (340s)-it has limited capability to record (342s)-isn''t it (345s)-if I press 2 if fire comes (348s)-what does it mean bad memory (351s)-or bad keyboard (354s)-bad keyboard so this is a question of (357s)-bad keyboard (358s)-is not a question of bad memory (360s)-it''s very important that you''ll you call (364s)-2-2 not far (368s)-it is a question of bad keyboard don''t (371s)-try to fix the memory memory is great (374s)-everything that you see is recorded (376s)-you''re not able to type out the right (379s)-number (380s)-that''s all the problem is isn''t it (383s)-so this is not a question of memory this (386s)-is a question of clarity (388s)-so we have to work on Clarity what is it (391s)-that gives us Clarity of mind (395s)-first thing is we learn to if if our (399s)-Clarity is not not good by itself (402s)-the simple thing is (404s)-handle things with a certain (407s)-precision (414s)- (426s)-where your feet should be prepared (429s)-not here like this where your hand (432s)-should be like this (435s)-it''s not proper (437s)- (441s)-inserting all this my head is looking (443s)-down oh not like this (446s)-like this (448s)-precision (450s)-now you come down when you sit down (453s)-you watch this okay how your pants (456s)-should be like this (460s)-whatever you brought with you your book (462s)-where your notebook should sit where you (465s)-spend suits it they should sit just (467s)-practice this (468s)-with every little thing just bring the (471s)-Precision into your activity it will (474s)-happen in your mind (476s)-you will see then if I say this it goes (480s)-to number two it won''t go to five (485s)-yes (487s)-now gets confused so handle it slowly (490s)-two three one (494s)-okay two is here 3 is here one is here (498s)-you just do this with every aspect of (500s)-your life (501s)-you go to bed how it should be (504s)-everything (506s)-you go in your room how it should be (509s)-just bring this meticulousness of what (512s)-you''re doing with the Asana into your (513s)-life you will see slowly mind will (517s)-become very very clear it becomes (519s)-meticulous with everything (521s)-the simple practice that you have to do (523s)-from this moment when you stand up when (526s)-you sit down when you walk and when you (529s)-go out here (530s)-you just look like this like you''re (532s)-doing what (535s)-chandrasana like this (537s)-how many columns in this (540s)-don''t try to count all of them the first (542s)-row if you simply look like this oh it''s (546s)-five columns (549s)-just you must register this five columns (553s)-one vessel (555s)-one sitting Rock one big rock one Pond (559s)-another three another four columns one (562s)-door how tall looks like twelve feet (566s)-just do this (568s)-with everything how many steps from here (571s)-to there don''t count like one two like (574s)-this (576s)-oh after you take three steps okay (579s)-that''s I think three (580s)-another three another three another (582s)-three (583s)-after a few days count eleven (587s)-or fourth or five (590s)-just like that without thinking you must (592s)-slowly know that okay I think I work 12 (596s)-steps (598s)-this is yoga (601s)-the this effect will happen over a (603s)-period of time by itself but now we are (606s)-in a hurry (607s)-so use the mind also (610s)-to do it to bring the Precision what (612s)-you''re trying to bring in your body (614s)-bring that Precision in your mind also (616s)-let the Mind imitate the body (619s)-you will see Clarity will naturally come (622s)-memory is not the problem everything is (624s)-anywhere recorded (629s)-I will abuse you right now (632s)-I''m going to abuse you badly (634s)-try to forget it (639s)-will you for all your life you''ll (641s)-remember it (643s)-yes or no so you got great memory you (646s)-just remember bad words that''s all (654s)- (657s)-if you exercise your mind like this (661s)-it''ll become in such a way (663s)-that you can make it do what you want (666s)-you will see slowly mind will become (669s)-very very clear (671s)- (673s)-when your mind is single pointed it''s a (675s)-powerful instrument (678s)-this is something that you do within (680s)-yourself (681s)-so that you''re able to slip behind the (684s)-mind (686s)-if we know who is behind the mirror then (689s)-we can change everything

(174s)-next the cakes head to baking (176s)-but this step also has a unique twist (179s)-a lot of bakeries use rack ovens where (182s)-you just slide the whole Rack in and (184s)-Slide the whole rack out it doesn''t work (186s)-for our cheesecake his team bakes the (188s)-dense cakes in a water bath (190s)-spreads the heat evenly the bottoms of (193s)-the cakes don''t burn they rise up like a (196s)-souffle you can see how the cakes are (198s)-literally above the pan (200s)-when they''re golden brown workers pull (202s)-out the trays and pour out leftover (204s)-water (206s)-then they test the internal temperature (209s)-they take temperatures for food safety (211s)-but I can see with my eyes after they''ve (213s)-rested the cakes aren''t jiggly anymore (215s)-we don''t do jiggly we do juniors (218s)-using this repurposed Pizza Oven Bakers (221s)-can heat the pans just enough to release (223s)-the settled cakes after the cheesecakes (226s)-get deep and (227s)-we bring them into our blast freezer (230s)-Allen keeps it at a balmy zero degrees (233s)-inside but it''s not just plain or (235s)-swirled cheesecakes in this freezer the (237s)-company whips up dozens of different (239s)-flavors of cheesecakes layer cakes and (241s)-desserts (242s)-the chocolate mousse cheesecake is hit (244s)-with a heaping pile of moose doused in a (247s)-waterfall of chocolate and covered in (249s)-mini chocolate chips there''s also the (251s)-pumpkin layer cake cheesecake robots and (254s)-Bakers work together to ice it (257s)-leftover cake tops are ground up to make (260s)-the crumb that goes around the edges all (263s)-the finished and chilled cakes Converge (265s)-on the packaging line from the pumpkin (267s)-cheesecake to the 24 mini cheesecake (270s)-variety pack Bound for Costco (273s)-workers Place each cake in a box slap on (275s)-a label and put it in an even bigger box (277s)-that all heads to the freezer a second (280s)-time (281s)-this will all be gone within 30 days (285s)-right now it''s enough space but I can (287s)-see maybe next year us needing even more (289s)-space this is going around the whole (291s)-country most of the six inch cheesecakes (293s)-end up in one of the 12 000 supermarkets (296s)-supplied by Juniors (298s)-from Wegmans to Kroger Publix Stop and (301s)-Shop ShopRite

keyboard so this is a question of (357s)-bad keyboard (358s)-is not a question of bad memory (360s)-it''s very important that you''ll you call (364s)-2-2 not far (368s)-it is a question of bad keyboard don''t (371s)-try to fix the memory memory is great (374s)-everything that you see is recorded (376s)-you''re not able to type out the right (379s)-number (380s)-that''s all the problem is isn''t it (383s)-so this is not a question of memory this (386s)-is a question of clarity (388s)-so we have to work on Clarity what is it (391s)-that gives us Clarity of mind (395s)-first thing is we learn to if if our (399s)-Clarity is not not good by itself (402s)-the simple thing is (404s)-handle things with a certain (407s)-precision (414s)- (426s)-where your feet should be prepared (429s)-not here like this where your hand (432s)-should be like this (435s)-it''s not proper (437s)- (441s)-inserting all this my head is looking (443s)-down oh not like this (446s)-like this (448s)-precision (450s)-now you come down when you sit down (453s)-you watch this okay how your pants (456s)-should be like this (460s)-whatever you brought with you your book (462s)-where your notebook should sit where you (465s)-spend suits it they should sit just (467s)-practice this (468s)-with every little thing just bring the (471s)-Precision into your activity it will (474s)-happen in your mind (476s)-you will see then if I say this it goes (480s)-to number two it won''t go to five (485s)-yes (487s)-now gets confused so handle it slowly (490s)-two three one (494s)-okay two is here 3 is here one is here (498s)-you just do this with every aspect of (500s)-your life (501s)-you go to bed how it should be (504s)-everything (506s)-you go in your room how it should be (509s)-just bring this meticulousness of what (512s)-you''re doing with the Asana into your (513s)-life you will see slowly mind will (517s)-become very very clear it becomes (519s)-meticulous with everything (521s)-the simple practice that you have to do (523s)-from this moment when you stand up when (526s)-you sit down when you walk and when you (529s)-go out here (530s)-you just look like this like you''re (532s)-doing what (535s)-chandrasana like this (537s)-how many columns in this (540s)-don''t try to count all of them the first (542s)-row if you simply look like this oh it''s (546s)-five columns (549s)-just you must register this five columns (553s)-one vessel (555s)-one sitting Rock one big rock one Pond (559s)-another three another four columns one (562s)-door how tall looks like twelve feet (566s)-just do this (568s)-with everything how many steps from here (571s)-to there don''t count like one two like (574s)-this (576s)-oh after you take three steps okay (579s)-that''s I think three (580s)-another three another three another (582s)-three (583s)-after a few days count eleven (587s)-or fourth or five (590s)-just like that without thinking you must (592s)-slowly know that okay I think I work 12 (596s)-steps (598s)-this is yoga (601s)-the this effect will happen over a (603s)-period of time by itself but now we are (606s)-in a hurry (607s)-so use the mind also (610s)-to do it to bring the Precision what (612s)-you''re trying to bring in your body (614s)-bring that Precision in your mind also (616s)-let the Mind imitate the body (619s)-you will see Clarity will naturally come (622s)-memory is not the problem everything is (624s)-anywhere recorded (629s)-I will abuse you right now (632s)-I''m going to abuse you badly (634s)-try to forget it (639s)-will you for all your life you''ll (641s)-remember it (643s)-yes or no so you got great memory you (646s)-just remember bad words that''s all (654s)- (657s)-if you exercise your mind like this (661s)-it''ll become in such a way (663s)-that you can make it do what you want (666s)-you will see slowly mind will become (669s)-very very clear (671s)- (673s)-when your mind is single pointed it''s a (675s)-powerful instrument (678s)-this is something that you do within (680s)-yourself (681s)-so that you''re able to slip behind the (684s)-mind (686s)-if we know who is behind the mirror then (689s)-we can change everything

        Transcripts:
        SPEAKER_1: (41s)-And so SSH keys, they''re the worst thing
ever, they''re the best thing ever. (44s)-They allow you to have really
easy access onto systems. (47s)-But you either have to regenerate a new
one every time you get a computer, (50s)-and then go to GitHub,
go to stash, go to Bitbucket, (52s)-go to wherever you have to go, GitLab. (54s)-And reput them all in, and
then wherever else you have to go, really, (57s)-really annoying. (59s)-Well, Ansible comes with
something called ansible-vault. (62s)-Now this thing is pretty darn awesome. (64s)-So I''m gonna give you
a little quick example, okay? (66s)-So let''s come in here and
let''s create a file, all right? (70s)-And let''s call this one, wow,
I already have a test file. (73s)-What''s in here? (73s)-My goodness, hello FrontEnd Masters. (75s)-Look at this, we already have a test file. (76s)-How beautiful is this? (78s)-So I''m gonna take this thing down and
I''m gonna run ansible-vault, (83s)-and then I''m gonna encrypt and
I''m gonna choose testfile, right? (88s)-And it''s gonna say, hey,
give me a password. (90s)-So I''m gonna type in
a super secret password. (94s)-And then I''m gonna do it again,
and that''s that. (97s)-It''s gonna say, encryption successful. (98s)-So let''s cat out the testfile,
there we go. (101s)-Now this is what the testfile looks like. (103s)-I could commit this to a public repo. (105s)-AES256 is said to be
likely quantum secure. (109s)-So at least for the next while, (111s)-you''re gonna be safe using
this type of encryption. (113s)-It seems pretty good. (116s)-And you can store it on public repos. (117s)-There you go, it''s out there,
everything''s fine. (119s)-And if I wanted to get out the value,
I could do ansible-vault decrypt, and (124s)-then, oop, don''t wanna put that one
out there, and then do testfile. (129s)-And I could decrypt the testfile,
put in my super secret password. (132s)-And now when I cat out my testfile,
what do I see? (135s)-Hello, FrontEnd Masters. (136s)-So it''s a two-way encryption
that works really nicely. (139s)-But you''re probably asking yourself,
okay, that''s neat. (143s)-And now I don''t have to store my SSH
keys in my email or on a private server. (148s)-I can actually do that. (149s)-But still, that''s kind of manual, right? (151s)-I''d have to decrypt them,
move them into the correct location. (154s)-I don''t wanna do that, right? (156s)-I don''t wanna do it. (157s)-I don''t wanna be a part of any of that. (158s)-You''re right, you don''t wanna do that,
and you don''t have to do that. (162s)-So I''ve included the code, but I''m only
gonna just lightly go over the code. (167s)-Cuz I looked it up on the Internet,
I cut, I pasted it, (171s)-it worked first try, it was beautiful. (175s)-I defined a couple of vars,
where my current SSH key is, (178s)-where I want to install it. (180s)-Some basic information about it like, hey, (181s)-I wanna create a directory with
the correct permissions, say, 700, right? (185s)-I want to be able to copy my
source to my destination. (188s)-I''ve also tagged it with dotfiles and SSH. (191s)-So if I install my dotfiles, I also
need to install these tasks as well. (196s)-I need to have my SSH keys up and running
for my dotfiles to be properly running. (200s)-I do a bunch of this other stuff,
set my authorized key so that it works so (203s)-I can have both. (204s)-So I''m using it from here on out. (206s)-If I do a Git operation,
it''s gonna be ensured to be working. (210s)-And, of course,
I can do something that looks like this. (212s)-I can go and
I can clone down a public repo, and (215s)-then update my submodules,
which are private. (219s)-And it will use my SSH key that
I just got done decrypting. (222s)-So let me show you kind
of what that looks like. (224s)-Here''s effectively the exact
thing we will be executing. (228s)-So I''m gonna go like this. (229s)-I''m gonna rerun a new docker, and (232s)-I''m gonna just use my actual
Ansible thing I''ve been using. (238s)-So here''s my Ansible. (239s)-So I''m gonna go ansible-playbook,
and I''m gonna run dotfiles. (243s)-That''s my tag for all my dotfiles cuz
I want things to be up and running. (246s)-And then I''m gonna also do ask-vault-pass,
right? (251s)-And then on top of that,
I''m gonna just specify local.yml. (255s)-Now I''m gonna put in my
very secret passcode. (261s)-Don''t look at it too much, there we go. (263s)-And there we go. (265s)-It''s gonna go through. (265s)-It''s gonna ensure that SSH
is installed correctly. (268s)-And it''s gonna go through and
install all my zsh, zsh, all that, (272s)-make sure vim plug is there. (274s)-It''s gonna install that stows there. (275s)-It''s gonna clone down
my dotfile repository. (278s)-Not only that, but it''s gonna
recursively get everything else with it. (281s)-It''s gonna stow my dotfiles. (282s)-You don''t know what stow is yet. (284s)-Then it''s gonna get a bunch of my personal
projects that I need, and boom, it''s done. (288s)-Now I''m gonna open up nvim. (289s)-It''s gonna have some errors because I''ve
yet to figure out this one how to make (291s)-this thing work, but
then I''m just gonna go PlugInstall. (294s)-And once it goes through and does all of
this, all right, blah blah blah blah blah, (299s)-there we go. (300s)-Look how beautiful that is. (302s)-Everything is wonderful. (303s)-There we go. (305s)-And now I can quit. (307s)-Quit, when I reopen up vim,
it''s now in the way I would like it. (310s)-All my keyboard shortcuts work. (312s)-I can do everything that I wanted to do,
oopsies. (315s)-Everything just works as is. (317s)-Because now, my vim''s up and running and
all my dotfiles have been there and (320s)-they are private with an SSH key. (322s)-Now, for me, this was a huge thing. (324s)-That made me really excited. (326s)-Cuz I absolutely just hated how
I''ve handled SSH keys in the past. (330s)-This is awesome. (331s)-Now it just works. (333s)-And I can have them stored in a place
where I''m not gonna lose them, right? (337s)-And that''s a big thing for me is that I
don''t wanna have to regenerate them and (339s)-I don''t wanna lose them. (340s)-And I don''t want them just on
someplace that can get hacked. (343s)-I want them secure. (344s)-And I feel like this was one of
the best solutions I''ve seen out there, (347s)-where I can get a system up and running
even with those private keys so quick. (351s)-And I feel like this is one of the biggest
selling points of Ansible, but (354s)-I wanna kinda think about it for a second. (357s)-Besides for SSH keys, what else
could we store with ansible-vault? (363s)-Well, I feel like everybody here probably
knows what this symbol is, right? (369s)-How many of you are locked out of Binance
right now because you have lost your (374s)-password and you don''t have your
backup codes for Binance, right? (378s)-My goodness,
you can''t get your cryptocurrencies. (381s)-Your millions of Dogecoin just sitting
there being wasted away right now. (385s)-It''s because you don''t have a way to
store your private information easily. (391s)-So something I''ve been doing is I''ve
actually been going through my auth codes. (395s)-And here we go.
Here''s my Discord backup codes, right? (398s)-All right, so
if I get locked out of Discord, (400s)-I have my backup codes already here,
ready to rock. (403s)-I don''t even have to worry about it. (405s)-For me, this was just like a huge
thing cuz it''s gonna save me 100-fold. (412s)-And so now, not only do I have all
my installation and everything. (415s)-I also have all the keys to
the kingdom in case things break, (418s)-in case I lose my phone, all that. (420s)-I just have to get to a computer and
have Ansible installed and (423s)-I can get the backup codes back out. (425s)-For me, this was just awesome. (427s)-This is just like such a selling point. (429s)-That''s why this talk, I felt like this
section went from the most boring section (433s)-to the most awesome section. (434s)-Because it''s just like, I''ve been screwed
by this so many times in my lifetime and (438s)-I don''t have to have it anymore.

        Transcripts:
        SPEAKER_1: (440s)-This is kind of an idea right here. (442s)-Every one of these folders that exist
right here, every one of these folders (446s)-that exist at each one of these
levels are likely a Git project or (450s)-a folder I want to navigate
to as quickly as possible. (453s)-Obviously, I don''t wanna navigate to
somewhere really deep in here, right? (456s)-I don''t need to go to the node
module folder somewhere deep down or (460s)-nodes module, that weird thing
that happens with node modules. (464s)-Those are the folders that I''m
super concerned about, right? (467s)-Those are the places I want
to get to immediately. (470s)-And on top of it, I love fuzzy finding. (473s)-For those that don''t know what fzf or
fuzzy finding, (475s)-fzf is a specific fuzzy finder. (477s)-It just stands for fuzzy finding,
right, a fuzzy finder. (479s)-If you don''t know what that is, or
the best way to kinda say it is that, (483s)-have you ever used Ctrl+P in VS Code,
if that''s more familiar to you. (486s)-Ctrl+P brings up all of your files, right? (489s)-And you can start typing and it finds
the file with a few keystrokes, right? (493s)-That''s a fuzzy finder. (494s)-It means you can type a partial match
to a string and it''ll return to you all (498s)-the strings in some sort of
sorted order that makes sense. (501s)-Fzf has a lot of options, blah blah blah. (503s)-But it''s just a fuzzy finder. (505s)-It''s good to know. (506s)-This is very, very good to know. (508s)-All right, so I wanna be able
to take these two things and (511s)-I wanna be able to create a Tmux
experience out of them, right? (515s)-I wanna take all these folders right
here and I wanna be able to navigate to (518s)-them instantly and
I want to filter them via fzf. (522s)-So that is what I want to create. (523s)-And we''re gonna create that right now,
because I want better, (528s)-faster, smoother navigation. (530s)-All right, that seems about right, right? (533s)-So we do know a command, right? (535s)-We did walk through this command earlier. (537s)-We can create a session and
we can name it. (540s)-We can detach it, awesome , right? (542s)-It''s beautiful, it''s exactly what we want. (545s)-But did you know, I know, my goodness,
you can create a new session? (549s)-And you can even say, hey, this is
the directory I want you to go to, right? (554s)-So we can actually even tell it
what directory to go to with -c. (558s)-We can create a new window with
a directory it should go to. (562s)-And we can also call switch-client. (564s)-Switch-client will switch to a new client,
and it uses this -t parameter. (570s)-Now the -t parameter,
you''ll put it on switch-client. (575s)-What would effectively it does,
it allows you to put in a session name. (579s)-Now, I only ever use session name, but (581s)-you can''t even go further and
do window name and pane number. (587s)-So you can really give it a really
targeted string to jump to. (591s)-And so if you name your windows as well,
you could even fuzzy find into that. (596s)-You could list your sessions and
then fuzzy find across it and (599s)-jump in if you have really well
named session and window schemes. (603s)-It''s pretty darn cool. (605s)-But I tend to just do session name foobar,
right? (609s)-So right now,
just kinda show to you, there''s bar. (612s)-That''s one of the sessions name is bar. (613s)-So we''re in foo right now. (614s)-So I can go tmux switch-client. (618s)-No, I didn''t spell that right at all. (620s)-And then do t and go foo, right? (622s)-And by doing that,
we are currently in foo. (625s)-I thought I was in bar. (626s)-So now instead, tricking you guys,
making sure you''re paying attention, (630s)-we press bar and we jump over the bar. (632s)-So look at that,
I programmatically switched session. (635s)-So we''re like, okay, (636s)-we have a lot of the tools here to
create this style of navigation, right? (640s)-We know that there''s commands that
exist that we can do this with. (644s)-We know what folders we want to do it. (648s)-And we know that we want the fuzzy
finder to be able to help us. (651s)-So there''s kind of a lot
of things going on here. (654s)-And lastly, there''s another command that
I have right here that we don''t need this (658s)-time, but we''re gonna need pretty near,
or you may want soon, (661s)-is you can also include
a command right here. (664s)-So not only can you create a new
window with a name, you can also say, (668s)-hey, run Node.js, whatever, right? (670s)-So you can actually tell
it to do something. (673s)-And lastly,
always read the friendly manual. (676s)-I believe that''s what that
abbreviation stands for, RTFM, (679s)-always read the friendly manual. (681s)-It''s very important to do that. (683s)-And so man tmux actually has a lot
of information inside of it. (686s)-If you''re not familiar with man,
which stands for manual, do man man. (690s)-It''ll tell you actually
how to read a manual and (693s)-what it means,
what each one of these numbers mean. (696s)-Along with it, it''ll even tell you like,
bold means type it exactly as shown, okay? (701s)-So let''s go back to tmux man. (702s)-Look at that, this means type
it exactly like this, tmux. (706s)-It actually gives you
a lot of information. (708s)-And once you read through
the man''s manual, (710s)-it makes a lot more sense
reading manual pages. (712s)-Actually they''re very, very nice, and (714s)-tmux is particularly nice
cuz it has everything in it. (717s)-You''re confused at how
switch-client works. (720s)-Well, here you go,
here''s every single option, all of it. (723s)-Here''s the alias that it''s also known by. (725s)-Here''s everything that I can possibly do. (727s)-It''s very, very nice to learn these
commands using this little manual page. (730s)-I always recommend reading
the friendly manual. (734s)-So now we have our items we can easily
search for and easily fuzzy find over. (739s)-Now obviously, I can make this a really
big list, but for the point of this, (743s)-I don''t think I need to make
this as big as possible. (746s)-It just needs to be obvious how it works. (748s)-So there we go,
we have these two things, and (750s)-now we need to select the thing we want. (752s)-So really, we could do fzf, right? (754s)-Pipe that into fzf, perfect. (756s)-So let''s just try it out. (758s)-Here we go, c, boom, c, beautiful. (761s)-Just always makes me feel so (763s)-good when things just work
how you want them to work. (765s)-So now, of course, selected,
we have one of those. (768s)-There we go, everything''s great,
look at that. (770s)-We''re practically done with our
script at this point, it''s fantastic. (774s)-Now I also learned this recently fumbling
around trying to make the script a couple (778s)-of weeks ago on Twitch when people
repetitively told me that I am a script (781s)-kid and I don''t know what I''m doing. (783s)-Well, let me show you me
knowing what I''m doing. (786s)-We''re gonna echo out languages, and
we''re gonna pipe it into grep, and (789s)-we''re gonna do qs. (790s)-Effectively, we''re making it silent. (791s)-We''re not returning the results and
we just want to know, (794s)-did we find it or did we not find it? (797s)-Is selected within the languages, right? (800s)-Cuz remember, if we look right here, (803s)-when we use languages,
it''s like a different way we do it. (807s)-It''s a space delimited item. (809s)-When we use core utils,
it''s not a space delimited item. (813s)-Again, my God, it''s so straight. (816s)-So here we go. (818s)-So let''s jump into here, go right there. (820s)-Let''s just prove it, right.? (822s)-Let''s go like this,
echo I AM LANGUAGE, right? (826s)-Take that fl, go here, and (829s)-then go I AM CORE YOUDIL,
there you go, YOUDIL. (835s)-That''s how I say it. (835s)-Is that normal? (836s)-Probably not. (837s)-All right, let''s cht.sh, let''s try it
with sed, I AM CORE YOUDIL, perfect. (841s)-Let''s try typescript. (842s)-I AM LANGUAGE, my goodness,
this is going so good. (846s)-Everything''s working. (846s)-By the way, this is how I develop bash. (848s)-For anyone that wants to know, whenever
I''m doing bash type things, I go back and (852s)-forth like this a lot cuz bash is just,
I never get it right. (856s)-This is such a hard language, I swear. (859s)-It feels so easy, but
I get it wrong every single time. (862s)-We have this. (863s)-So now what we need to do is we need
to create that curl command, right? (867s)-So let''s try this. (868s)-Let''s go like this, curl cht.sh, and
then we got our selected, right? (872s)-That''s the thing we selected. (874s)-And since we''re under the languages,
all we gotta do now is go like this, echo. (878s)-We need a query, don''t we? (879s)-We need a query. (880s)-So let''s go like this, read -p,
and that p stands for prompt. (885s)-Give me your query, right, there we go. (888s)-And we''re gonna make it
go into variable query. (891s)-So we''re gonna echo query down here and
we''re gonna pipe it into tr, right? (896s)-And tr, we''re gonna wanna replace
every space with plus signs. (899s)-Now for whatever reason, I''ve decided
right here I wanna use single quotes, (903s)-which just seems asinine to use single
quotes in one single spot in your entire (906s)-language. (907s)-There we go. (908s)-So this should do exactly
what we think it should do. (910s)-It should curl cht.sh with
our selected language, and (915s)-then have our plus delimited query string. (919s)-Down here, we''re gonna wanna do
with just a touch different. (922s)-Instead, we''re gonna wanna do that
little tilde and go query, right? (925s)-Query, awesome, so
that should do the other part of it. (929s)-So if we do find exact, this should work. (931s)-So let''s find out. (931s)-Let''s go like this, let''s quit it. (934s)-Let''s go in here, wrong script. (936s)-And let''s go, I just quit vim. (938s)-Let''s open up vim cuz it
just feels better, right? (940s)-There we go, let''s go over here. (942s)-And let''s go cht.sh, and
let''s use, did I add find? (945s)-I did add find. (946s)-So there we go, we got find. (946s)-Give me your query. (948s)-Let''s do exact, right? (949s)-All right, there''s everything that has
to do with exact, right here, awesome. (953s)-So this is really working, right? (956s)-I feel like we''re really doing something,
and I''m awesome. (959s)-Okay, this is looking good. (961s)-But the problem is we''re not
tmuxed out of our mind yet. (964s)-Right now, we''re still just kind of
lightly tmuxing, and I don''t want that. (967s)-I just want this to be
the greatest thing ever. (970s)-So how should we go about this? (972s)-So let''s think about that. (973s)-We have two options. (975s)-We could create a new pane, which I''ve
never done and someone suggested. (979s)-And honestly,
it kinda feels like a great challenge. (982s)-So let''s try a new pane for a second. (983s)-If not, I''ll just fall back to
the way I already pre-planned. (986s)-But we''re going off script now, okay? (987s)-People, we''re going all in on this one,
I know. (990s)-This has to be the one. (991s)-It has to be split. (992s)-Create a new pane by splitting
the target pane, okay? (996s)-Does a horizontal split,
v does a vertical split, awesome. (999s)-Okay, so I''m a vertical kinda guy. (1002s)-So let''s try this out. (1003s)-So we''re gonna go with this,
tmux split-window, and (1007s)-my guess is it''s -v for vertical. (1010s)-This is feeling good. (1011s)-We won''t provide a target cuz I''m gonna
assume that if there''s no target, (1014s)-it does my current window. (1016s)-split-window, you never know, yeah,
never mind, split-window''s right here, (1018s)-shell-command. (1019s)-Okay,  all right, and
we even have starting directory we can do. (1023s)-Environment, we can provide
environment variables. (1025s)-Really cool, by the way, that you
can provide environment variables. (1028s)-That means you could actually have certain
things in this, and you could start a db (1031s)-environment, which already has all
your connections and everything. (1035s)-A lot of cool things you can do here. (1036s)-So I think this should probably be okay. (1040s)-Let''s go like this, split-window
vertically, and then let''s just do this. (1045s)-So let''s go like this. (1045s)-Let''s go bash -c and
let''s just pass this into less. (1050s)-Less is like a super
duper ultra cool program. (1052s)-Okay, I''m gonna be, let''s see,
we got a lot of escaping to do here. (1057s)-Let''s escape with passion and theory. (1059s)-I don''t think I need to escape those ones. (1061s)-Let''s just see,
I don''t think I need to escape anything. (1063s)-Let''s just find out. (1064s)-All right, so let''s do this again. (1067s)-I keep closing my vim command there for
a second. (1069s)-So let''s do cht.sh,
let''s do typescript, let''s do enum. (1073s)-And there we go, yes. (1074s)-First off, tmux is backwards,
which part of me just feels very upset. (1079s)-And so let''s go back into vim now. (1081s)-And let''s go back to load cht.sh. (1083s)-So there we go. (1083s)-So we just piped into less so
it would work. (1085s)-And then, of course, let''s fix that very
poor vertical thing to make it horizontal. (1090s)-And let''s run it again, I closed vim
again, clearly out of my element here, (1095s)-enum, and there you go. (1097s)-Now I have this. (1098s)-And so now I can scroll around
here to see what''s going on. (1101s)-So obviously, there''s nothing here. (1102s)-So the moment I press Q, it quits. (1104s)-It also quits the split, we''re back here. (1106s)-That''s actually pretty cool. (1107s)-That''s a pretty good
experience right there. (1109s)-

SPEAKER_1: (350s)-has four restaurants in the New York (352s)-area a quick service at LaGuardia (354s)-Airport a direct to Consumer business (356s)-and a booming retail presence oh we''re (360s)-definitely the biggest cheesecake (361s)-company in New York so the top seller in (363s)-our restaurants is either strawberry (365s)-cheesecake or New York style cheesecake (368s)-visitors from all over the world stop in (370s)-for a slice yeah my name is Marvin I''m (373s)-from Germany brownie explosion (375s)-cheesecake I think it''s like a full meal (379s)-but keeping up with all this demand for (381s)-cheesecake hasn''t been easy even for a (384s)-giant like juniors (386s)-in 2020 the pandemic shut down all of (389s)-the restaurants (390s)-I I sort of joked with my mom that (394s)-thankfully my dad was pre-dece you know (396s)-was deceased before covet because covid (398s)-would have killed him not the disease (400s)-but the fact that his restaurants his (402s)-babies were not doing what they were (405s)-supposed to do for in some cases 14 or (408s)-19 months (409s)-at the time the companies direct to (411s)-Consumer sales actually doubled but then (414s)-came the great cream cheese shortage of (415s)-2021. last year we started like we heard (419s)-about it and then all of a sudden Jason (421s)-calls me and says there''s no cream (422s)-cheese I''m like what do you mean you (425s)-can''t make you can''t make cheesecake (426s)-without cream cheese a Cyber attack hit (428s)-a cream cheese factory in Wisconsin it (430s)-wasn''t Philadelphia''s facility but craft (433s)-faced spiking demand and supply chain (435s)-issues of its own the company struggled (437s)-to get a hold of starch thickeners and (439s)-packaging materials without any cream (441s)-cheese Allen had to shut down the (443s)-factory and the team missed a couple of (445s)-big orders (447s)-and a couple of orders for us or (448s)-trailers full about 70 I think 70 000 (451s)-pounds so it''s a big deal I was I was (454s)-sweating it out pretty good (456s)-by early 2022 craft had restored cream (458s)-cheese supplies to Juniors so we are one (461s)-of the biggest users of cream cheese in (464s)-the country just in time for inflation (466s)-to hit every ingredient is right now (469s)-from eggs to show (472s)-him cheese is definitely the highest (473s)-priced ingredient that we use right now (476s)-Allen says the price Juniors pays for (478s)-cream cheese more than doubled from a (480s)-dollar fifty a pound to over three (482s)-dollars (483s)-the demand you know it''s based off of (485s)-the butter markets and dairy prices are (487s)-just very high right now and that''s why (489s)-it''s affecting the price of cream cheese (491s)-everything is up labor obviously is up (494s)-junior sales have bounced back to (496s)-pre-pandemic levels with 110 million in (499s)-expected sales this year (501s)-but costs have escalated so dramatically (504s)-that profits in the restaurant business (506s)-and the wholesale business are way down (508s)-Allen said profit margins dropped by six (511s)-percent oh it''s brutal no there''s no (514s)-doubt it is the hardest time in my I (516s)-mean I''ve been doing this for 33 years (518s)-and I''ve never seen a time like this (520s)-ever so Alan made the decision to raise (523s)-prices our product cost has literally (525s)-doubled for cheesecake doubled we can''t (528s)-double our prices that''s impossible (531s)-but Allen says higher retail prices (533s)-haven''t stopped customers (539s)-over many years believe it or not but (542s)-when I was a kid restaurants kind of (544s)-around where we''re from ordered this (546s)-cheesecake to be shipped to Oklahoma (549s)-City but even if food costs continue to (552s)-rise Allen says he''ll never touch the (555s)-recipe you know we had to move people (557s)-around and reschedule but we''re not (559s)-changing any recipes here that''s never (561s)-happening yeah we''d sooner not make cake (563s)-listen we have a 72-year history of (566s)-making cheesecake the exact way we''re (567s)-doing it exactly the same way forever (569s)-we''re not judging that so how does he (572s)-plan to stay afloat one with those (574s)-robots and then with new products from (577s)-Cheesecake shakes to updated cake (579s)-flavors like this strawberry Christmas (581s)-cheesecake (583s)-oh my God (584s)-that is so good (586s)-and finally Alan says diversifying (589s)-helped him weather the storms of recent (590s)-years of course Juniors has the (592s)-restaurants but what it makes from (594s)-Supermarket sales is quickly catching up (596s)-I would say it''s about 50 50. the (599s)-restaurants Drive about half the volume (601s)-of the company and this drives about (602s)-half the volume of the company I think (604s)-the fact that we are Diversified is what (606s)-saved us but is this business (608s)-sustainable if food prices keep (610s)-increasing you know what it''s the tell (612s)-will be in the next three months I think (614s)-it''s sustainable because I''m a big (615s)-believer in our business and how good we (617s)-are at it and that people are always (618s)-going to want a cheesecake (621s)-foreign (629s)-just got some delicious cheesecake (633s)-I''ll bring him up here it''s okay bring (636s)-them up

Chapter: Silken Tofu 
1. Unique Ideas:
- The biggest difference between silken tofu and other types of tofu is that it is set inside the container which makes it harder to get out (278s)
- The traditional Chinese home cooking method of getting silken tofu out of the container if it doesn''t come out naturally is to cut a corner to let air in (309s)
- Another way to get silken tofu out of the container is to carve the desired shape directly into the container and then invert it (351s)
- Silken tofu is delicate so it needs to be dehydrated a little bit before pan-searing to remove surface moisture (416s)

1. Summary of Unique Ideas:
- (470s) Cook explains two-stage process to make pan-seared tofu dish
- (473s) First stage involves searing firm tofu to get a crust
- (475s) Second stage involves building a pan sauce to return the tofu to 
- (487s) Frozen firm tofu is generous to use
- (491s) Wait for oil to shimmer (or dance in Chinese) before cooking
- (496s) Quickly sear firm tofu to get a crust and avoid dehydrating it
- (513s) Final product is a saucy, semi-braised, pan-seared tofu dish 
2. Summary of Key Lessons:
- (499s) Avoid dehydrating the tofu by cooking it at too low temperature
- (539s) Apply even pressure on the tofu while searing to get a crisp crust on all sides
- (576s) Allow one side of tofu to become crispy while the other side does not get as brown, creating a desired textural contrast. 
Chapter: Sear Silken Tofu 
1. Unique Ideas:
- Salt doesn''t push out too much liquid from silken tofu but helps marinate it (604s-616s)
- Silken tofu has enough protein and sugars to get a golden brown crust (619s-623s)
- Use a non-stick pan with oil and wait for it to barely smoke before adding tofu (630s-642s)
- Gently shake tofu to see which pieces are stuck and concentrate on those (662s-678s)
- Press gently on tofu to cook evenly (682s-688s)
- Dehydrating the outside layer of silken tofu makes it firmer and easier to handle (702s-710s)
- Egg tofu is easier to handle and has a similar texture to silken tofu (747s-758s)
- Press down on tofu and check for bubbles to see if it''s mostly dehydrated (783s-796s)
2. Key Lessons:
- Be patient and gentle when cooking silken tofu to prevent it from breaking apart (606s, 666s)
- Use caution when handling hot tofu to avoid burns (646s, 723s)
- Don''t play with tofu too much, let it cook to form a crust (771s)
