{X} Profound Career Mistakes Everyone (From Intern To Executive) Should Avoid In Their Career,"A few {Time} ago, I asked {X} {Niche} leaders one simple question:
“What early career mistake will you never make again?”
What I ended up walking away with was a messy notepad full of notes, a completely new way of seeing the world, and {X} profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.
Let’s dive in:
Mistake #1: {Mistake1}
Too often, {Role} choose to {WrongDecision}.
They {WhyDecision}. They think {Logic}. Only to end up {BadOutcome}.
Instead, {Role} should be focused on {RightDecision}.
This is what ends up leading to {PositiveOutcome}, {PositiveOutcome}, and {PositiveOutcome}.
Mistake #2: {Mistake2}
A good {Role} can {GoodOutcome}.
A bad {Role} can {BadOutcome}.
But a legendary {Role} can {GiantOutcome}.
Don’t get it confused: a {GoodOutcome} is good, but it’s far from what makes the most difference.
Mistake #3: {Mistake3}
Until you’ve {Milestone}, don’t take your eye off the ball.
{”RelevantQuote”}.
To this day, I hang this quote up on my wall because it reminds me {Takeaway}.
Mistake #4: {Mistake4}
Traditional wisdom says {TraditionalWisdom}.
But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:
{RightDecision1}
{RightDecision2}
Then, {TraditionalWisdom} works great.
Mistake #5: {Mistake5}
We all think we can {Decision}.
We all think we have unlimited {Resource}.
We all think we are immune to {Disaster}.
But the truth is, we’re not.
Which is why it’s much better to operate from first principles, and {RightDecision} from the very beginning."
Template #3: Category POV,"In your chosen category, share one commonly held belief most people think is true (but is actually false/wrong/outdated/misunderstood/etc.).
Next, describe the problem in detail. Explain to the reader why this commonly held belief is so prevalent in society, or how it became a commonly held belief in the first place. And finally, tell the reader what this commonly held belief has resulted in.
List off a few examples:
Example #1
Example #2
Example #3
Now, in this subhead, tell the reader the reason this belief is flawed.
And in this first sentence, give the reader a concrete reason.
In this paragraph, expand on your argument. Share a personal story, or a study or stat that gives credibility and context to your perspective. And finally, tell the reader what new and different result they can expect if and when they abandon this old, commonly held belief and adopt this new perspective you're providing instead.
Now, tell them how:
In this subhead, tell them how to shift their mindset from ""old"" to ""new.""
This first sentence is an actionable step they can take, right away.
Next, explain what they can expect as a result from shifting their mindset. What new advantages or benefits will they experience in their own life? Be specific, and paint a clear picture of the future.
Finally, in this subhead, tell the reader why the ""old"" is going away for good.
Bring them back to the beginning of the article, and drive home your point.
Give a few quick reasons why the ""old"" is on its way out, and this ""new"" way of thinking is the future. And to send them off, give them one final reminder/example of what this new future will look like—and why it will be so valuable for them to be part of it."
The World’s Most Valuable Skill Is {Skill}. Here Are 5 Frameworks To Help You Master It In Record Time,"The world’s most valuable skill is {Skill}.
Unfortunately, {Obstacle} keeps people from ever learning how to do it. They spend hours (and usually a ton of money) trying to learn {OldWay}, all the while failing to realize the world has changed. The {OldWay} isn’t relevant anymore—because now, in order to be successful, you have to {NewWay}.
I know, because I wasted {Time} and {Money} trying to learn this myself.
But, my loss is your gain.
Here are {X} {Topic} frameworks that will save you dozens of painful hours trying to learn {Skill} yourself:
{Name}’s {Topic} Framework
Hearing this completely changed the way I thought about {Topic}.
According to {Name}, all you have to do is:
{Step1}
{Step2}
{Step3}
{Name}’s {Topic} Framework
Hang this up in your room somewhere—and stare at it everyday.
{Tip1}
{Tip2}
{Tip3}
{Name}’s {Topic} Framework
I consider this the Bible of {Topic}.
{Strategy1}
{Strategy2}
{Strategy3}
{Name}’s {Topic} Framework
Struggling with {Obstacle}?

{Step2}
{Step3}
{Name}’s {Topic} Framework
Finally, this is how you achieve {Outcome}:
{Tip1}
{Tip2}
{Tip3}
These {X} frameworks completely changed the way I thought about {Skill}.
If only I had discovered them sooner…"
The {X}-Step Strategy That Turned {Name} Into The {Status} Of {Topic},"{Name} is the {Status} of {Topic}.
But despite being one of the most {Achievement} in the world, most people have no clue how they did what they did. And honestly, neither did I. So, I took it upon myself to binge over {X} {Assets} of theirs to study exactly how—and see if I could find a repeatable framework I could use myself to achieve {Outcome}.
{X} hours later, here’s what I learned:
Quick Stats About {Name}
Here are a few interesting data points to give you context, in case you're unfamiliar with {Name}:
{AchievementStat1}
{AchievementStat2}
{AchievementStat3}
{AchievementStat4}
Needless to say, they’re one of the best in the world at {Outcome}.
So... what can we learn?
{Name}’s {X}-Step Framework For Achieving {Outcome}
From my research, all their success can be boiled down to a very simple process:
{Step1}
{Step2}
{Step3}
Pair this framework with an unmatched work ethic and you get a potent combination for rapid growth.
Let's dig in:
Step 1: {Step1}
For {Name}, everything begins with {Step1}.
The reason is because {Reason}.
To do this, {Name} does the following:
{Tactic1}
{Tactic2}
{Tactic3}
Simple, but highly effective.
Step 2: {Step2}
The next thing {Name} focuses on is {Step2}.
They do this by {Tactic}, and sometimes even {Tactic}. This is what separates them from the competition, and makes them stand out so much compared to the average person. I consider this their “secret sauce.”
Which leads us to…
Step 3: {Step3}
But the real reason {Name} is so successful at {Outcome} is because they are obsessive about:
{Tactic}
{Tactic}
{Tactic}
This, combined with {Step1} and {Step2} is what makes them so successful.
So, give the above and try, and maybe you will be the next {Status} of {Topic}!"

And today, {Creation} is one of the world’s most {Achievement}.
I have been fascinated by {ThoughtLeader}’s story for years, but recently I decided to go fully down the rabbit hole and learn everything I possibly could on {His/Her/Their} origin story and path to success. I probably spent {X} hours watching interviews, reading news articles, and listening to podcasts, taking notes and trying to piece their path together in a coherent way. Finally, I distilled their remarkable story down into a short essay for you to enjoy.
Here’s {ThoughtLeader}’s story:
QUICK BACKSTORY:
{ThoughtLeader} grew up in {Place}.
{Obstacle}
{WeirdFact}
THE ODDS:
To say {ThoughtLeader} was setup for success from the beginning would be an overstatement.
The odds of success for {Comparison} are {Odds}. And only {X%} make it to {FirstAccomplishment}. Which means {ThoughtLeader}’s odds of success were pretty much slim to none.

THE GOAL:
But {ThoughtLeader} had {His/Her/Their} sights set on {Goal}.
And for {Time}, they were relentless about {Habit1}, {Habit2}, {Habit3}.
THE OBSTACLE:
Unfortunately, success turned out to be a lot harder than they originally imagined.
{Obstacle1}
{Obstacle2}
{Obstacle3}
And by {Date}, they almost chose to give up.
THE BREAKTHROUGH:
Until one day, {MomentOfChange}.
As the story goes, {Story}.
And the rest is history.
THE ACHIEVEMENT:
Between {Date} and {Date}, {ThoughtLeader} went on to:
{Achievement1}
{Achievement2}
{Achievement3}
Maybe most importantly, they {Achievement4}.
THE LESSON:
I love {ThoughtLeader}’s story because it represents {LifeLesson}.

Success is not about {WrongAnswer}. Instead, it’s about practicing {Rule3} over and over again—until one day, you achieve {Outcome}.
Rule #4: {Rule4}
This one is my favorite.
Whether you are a {Audience1}, {Audience2}, or {Audience3}, this rule still applies. You have to {RepeatRule4} to achieve {Outcome}.
And usually makes all the difference.
Rule #5: {Rule5}

{ClicheAction} is a fast-track to {UndesirableOutcome}.

“Most people” do what “most people” do.
Which leads to…
{NegativeStat1}
{NegativeStat2}
{NegativeStat3}
Clearly what “most people do” doesn’t work.
So do something else.
{StrongOpinion4}
99% of the time, this is a giant mistake.
Instead, {Name} has a great framework for achieving {Outcome} without falling into {Trap}.
{Step1}
{Step2}

{StrongOpinion5}
Pursuing {Outcome} is a silly goal.
Because {UnconventionalReason}.
{DifferentOutcome} is a better pursuit in life.

The Wild Story Of How {Person/Company} Achieved {UnexpectedOutcome},"According to {Source}, {Person/Company} has officially reached {GiantOutcome}.
But here’s what you probably don’t know: When {Person/Company} first started back in {Date}, they had {NoOutcome}. But just a few {Time} later, they {FirstBigOutcome}.
How did this happen? {Twist}
Here’s the story:
The Very Beginning
{Person/Company}’s story begins in {Date}, {SpecificDetail}.
{UnexpectedAnecdote}.
And while there, {Person} wasn’t even trying to {Outcome}. So, they spent their time trying to find success doing random things like:
{Experience1}
{Experience2}
{Experience3}
Until one day, everything changed.
The Moment Of Change
{MomentOfChange}.
It was {Date} and {Name} became the first {Status}.
They saw this as an opportunity—and took it.
Their gameplan:
{Tactic1}
{Tactic2}
{Tactic}
As you can probably guess: it worked.
The Pinnacle Of Success
By {Date}, {Person} had risen to a wild level of success—way beyond they probably ever thought possible for themselves.
{Outcome1}
{Outcome2}
{Outcome3}
And the rest is history.
I love this story because it is the perfect encapsulation of what it takes to achieve {Outcome}, but also shows how in order to be “lucky,” you need to put yourself in a position to receive luck.
Great reminder for anyone with big dreams."
